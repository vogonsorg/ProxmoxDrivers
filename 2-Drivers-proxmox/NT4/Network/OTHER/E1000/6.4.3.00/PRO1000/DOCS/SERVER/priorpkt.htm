<h2>Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Priority Packet Overview</h2>
<p>Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Priority Packet is a utility that lets you set up priority filters to
process high priority network traffic before normal traffic. Using Priority
Packet, you set up priority filters to give priority to time-critical
traffic. This is also known as Traffic Class Expediting<i>.</i> You can set up global filters that apply to the entire
system or
network-component-specific filters that apply only to specific network
components (individual adapters or VLANs). You can also create
custom priority filters or use priority filter templates to assign filter
properties you use often. Priority Packet comes with pre-defined priority filter
templates or you can create your own templates.</p>
<p>Use Priority Packet filters for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="numlst">To tag packets with priority levels or forwarding behaviors.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">To drop incoming packets that match certain criteria.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">To count the number of packets that match certain criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Priority Packet is available on the Product CD. To install or run Priority Packet,
you must have administrative rights.</p>
  <p>To use Priority Packet with Microsoft* Windows 98 or Windows Me, you 
  must first enable remote DCOM connectivity on your system. For
  more information, visit the Microsoft web site at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/dcom.asp" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/dcom.asp</a></p>


<h4><b>Prioritizing Network Traffic </h4>
</b>
<p>Intel's Priority Packet lets you set up priority filters to send packets on
the network with an indicated priority or forwarding behavior. By prioritizing
traffic at the hosts or entry point of the network, network devices can base
forwarding decisions on priority information defined in the packet.</p>
<p>Priority filters are parameters you assign to packets. Using
Priority Filter Wizard, you set up filters from templates or define custom
priority filters based on the following traffic filter types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="numlst">Node (MAC) address</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Ethertype</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">TCP/IP information</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">IPX information</li>
</ul>
<p>Priority Packet provides the following methods for prioritizing traffic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="numlst">IEEE 802.1p Tagging</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">IP ToS (Type of Service) Layer 3 Tagging—supporting both Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) and Legacy IP
    Precedence</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Intel High Priority Queue</li>
</ul>
<b>
<h4>IEEE 802.1p Tagging</h4>
</b>
<p>802.1p is an IEEE standard for adding additional bytes of
information, also called tagging, to packets with different priority levels utilizing
four additional bytes in the header.  When these packets are sent out on the network, the higher priority
packets are transferred first by 802.1p-aware devices. To effectively use  802.1p tagging, the other devices receiving and routing 802.1p tagged
    packets must support 802.1p. 802.1p tagging lets you assign specific
priority levels from 0 (low) to 7 (high).</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" width="100%">

      <img border="0" src="caution.gif" width="28" height="21"></td>
      <td>
  <i>
  <b>CAUTION</b>:</i> 802.1p tagging increases the size of the packets. Some
  hubs and switches do not recognize the larger packets, and will drop them because they exceed
  the maximum frame size of standard Ethernet packets. Check
  your hub or switch documentation to see if it supports 802.1p.  If you are 
  using PRO/100 adapters and these routing devices do not support
  802.1p, or you are unsure, use High Priority Queue to prioritize network
  traffic.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>You can configure a switch to strip the tags from packets and send them on to 
the next destination as normal traffic.</p>
<p>You can specify 802.1p tagging using Priority
Packet, or when you create or assign a priority filter via Microsoft Windows 
2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003.
<b>
<h4>IP ToS Layer 3 Tagging</h4>
</b>
<p>Priority Packet supports two Type of Service (ToS) tagging methods:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="numlst">Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP)</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Legacy IP Precedence</li>
</ul>
<p>Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) is a new tagging method that classifies packets based on network policies and rules, not on priority. The tags assign one of 64 possible forwarding
behaviors known as per hop behaviors
(PHBs). A PHB provides a particular service level (bandwidth, queuing, and dropping decisions) in accordance with network policy. Using Priority Packet, DSCP tagging lets you assign assured forwarding (AF)
codepoints, using one of four AF classes and one of three drop precedence values. You may also enter your own non-standard
codepoints.</p>
<p>DSCP tags replace the existing IP header, and do not add any additional bytes
to packets. DSCP tags are backwards compatible with legacy ToS IP precedence
bits, so non-DSCP compliant, ToS-enabled devices do not conflict with the DSCP
mapping. A default DSCP mapping to &quot;best effort&quot; forwarding is
applied if network rules are not defined or the devices are non-DSCP compliant.</p>
<p>To assign DSCP, you can specify it using Priority Packet when you create or
assign a priority filter for IP traffic.</p>
<p>For more information on DSCP, see RFC <u><font COLOR="#008000"><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2474.txt" target="_blank">2474</a></font></u>
and <font COLOR="#008000"><u><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2475.txt" target="_blank">2475</a></u></font>
on the <u><font COLOR="#008000"><a href="http://www.ietf.org/" target="_blank">IETF (Internet
Engineering Task Force) Web site</a></font></u>.</p>
<p><b><i>Legacy IP Precedence</i></b> is an early tagging method that classifies and
prioritizes packets. When these packets are sent out on the network, the higher
priority packets are transferred first. Using Priority Packet, Legacy IP
Precedence tagging lets you assign the following specific priority levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="monospace">Network Control = 111 (7 in binary)<br>
Internet Control = 110 (6 in binary)<br>
CRITIC/ECP = 101 (5 in binary)<br>
Flash Override = 100 (4 in binary)<br>
Flash = 011 (3 in binary)<br>
Immediate = 010 (2 in binary)<br>
Priority = 001 (1 in binary)<br>
Routine = 000 (0 in binary)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To assign a Legacy IP Precedence, you can specify it using Priority Packet when you
create or assign a priority filter.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1"></font><b>
<p><a name="HPQ">Intel<sup>&reg;</sup>  High Priority Queue</a></p>
</b>
<p>If your network infrastructure devices do not support IEEE 802.1p or IP ToS,
or you are unsure if either is supported, you can still define priority filters
and transmit packets from the adapter onto the network as high priority. While
High Priority Queue (HPQ) does not provide the precise priority levels of 802.1p
and IP ToS tagging, it does assign traffic as either high or low priority, and
sends high priority packets first. Therefore, if there are multiple applications
on a system sending packets, the packets from the application with a priority
filter are sent out first. HPQ does not change network routing, nor does it add
any information to the packets.</p>
<p>To assign HPQ, you can specify it using Priority Packet when you create or assign a
priority filter.</p>
<p>If you add an adapter to a team, its filters are removed automatically. When you apply HPQ tagging to a team, you assign HPQ tagging to all
adapters in the same team, including any new ones subsequently added.</p>

<h3>Dropping Incoming Packets</h3>
<p>You can use Priority
Packet to specify that incoming packets of a certain type should be dropped.</p>
<h3>Counting Incoming or Outgoing Packets</h3>
<p>You can use Priority Packet to specify that you want all incoming or outgoing
packets of a certain type to be counted. This allows you to monitor, or track,
specific types of packets.
