<h1>Unattended Update Information for Windows* 98 and Me</h1>
<hr>
<h2>A note about Operating System support for the Intel(R) PRO/1000 T <br>
Desktop Adapter</h2>
<p>The drivers for the Intel(R) PRO/1000 T Desktop Adapter are only supported 
for Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows Millennium edition. The original 
Windows 98 does not support the NDIS 5 driver specification to which the driver 
was written.</p>
<h2>A note about computer names in Microsoft networks</h2>
<p>There cannot be more than one computer with a particular name on the network 
at any time, even during installation. Consequently to deploy Windows 9x on 
multiple computers, you must manually change the value of the computer name.<br>
<br>
Different configuration managers exist to overcome this hurdle in enterprise OS 
deployments. For more information on deploying Windows 98/ME in an enterprise 
network, consult the Windows 98 resource kit.</p>
<h2>Setting up an install directory on the file server</h2>
<p>Note: The network share Z:\PUSH is used here as an example path to the 
distribution folder. The distribution folder is where the setup files (Setup.exe 
and .CAB files) for Windows 9x reside. During the first step of the install, the 
client will connect to the distribution folder with IPX or TCP/IP.<br>
<br>
Before an unattended server based setup of Windows 9x can occur, a directory 
needs to be prepared.<br>
<br>
1. Copy the Win9x setup folder from the Windows CD to Z:\PUSH. Use Explorer, 
Winfile or XCOPY in order to maintain the same <br>
directory structure as on the CD.<br>
<br>
2. Use the pushcopy.bat batch file located in the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH directory on 
the Product CD to copy the necessary files to Z:\PUSH.<br>
<br>
Note: PUSHCOPY.BAT must be run from the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH directory on the 
product CD or 
from the download directory. The command to copy the Windows 98/ME files to the Z:\PUSH directory 
is:<br>
<br>
PUSHCOPY Z:\PUSH W9X<br>
<br>
Note: By default pushcopy.bat copies all of the files required to install the 
driver and PROSet II and PROSet II will be installed during the push 
installation. Comment out the following line in the [RunOnce.BatchDelay] section 
if you do not to install PROSet II.<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER,%KEY_RUNONCE%,BatchRun0,,&quot;c:\progra~1\Intel\proset.exe MsiPath=c:\Progra~1\Intel 
/qn&quot;<br>
<br>
3. Review the copy of MSBATCH.INF within the Z:\PUSH directory. Make any changes 
needed to customize the install. At a minimum you should change the ProductKey= 
entry in the [Setup] section, the Name= and Org= entries in the [NameAndOrg] 
section, and&nbsp; the ComputerName= entry in the [Network] section.<br>
<br>
Note: Be sure to read the comments in the [RunOnce.BatchDelay]<br>
section and uncomment the appropriate batch commands for your<br>
installation.</p>
<h2>Deployment Methods</h2>
<p>There are many ways to perform an unattended installation or upgrade 
including but not limited to:<br>
<br>
- Setting up a login script that executes a setup statement when each user logs 
in<br>
<br>
- Inserting an object in an email message that runs setup when the&nbsp; user 
clicks it<br>
<br>
- Using Microsoft SMS server to run Windows 9x Setup<br>
<br>
- Inserting a floppy that shares a drive on the network and runs setup from the 
shared drive<br>
<br>
- Copying the files to a local drive and then running an unattended setup from 
there<br>
<br>
- Use the Boot Strap Agent and an installed PXE Server. See the Boot Agent Users 
Guide for deployment suggestions and strategies for each OS.<br>
<br>
Each Network Administrator should determine the easiest way to accomplish 
this goal for his or her own network.<br>
<br>
To avoid possible areas where an unattended installation might be halted we 
recommend you use one of the following setup command lines for Windows 98 or 
Windows Millennium respectively:<br>
<br>
Note: Do not include the argument &quot;/ID&quot; if there is any doubt that there is 
sufficient free hard disk space.<br>
<br>
Windows 98:<br>
SETUP /IS /ID /IM /IE /IW<br>
- &quot;/IV&quot; turns off billboards and speeds up the setup.<br>
- &quot;/ID&quot; turns off free diskspace check<br>
<br>
Windows Millennium:<br>
SETUP /IS /ID /IM /IE /IW /IV</p>
