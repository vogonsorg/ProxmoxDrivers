<h1>Push Install Instructions for Windows Server 2003  </h1>
<p>	A "Push", or unattended installation of Windows Server 2003&nbsp; provides a means for network
administrators to easily install Windows Server 2003 on similarly equipped systems.  The network administrator can create a
bootable diskette that will automatically log into a central server and install the operating system from an image of the 
Windows Server 2003 installation directory stored on that server. This document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation
of Windows Server 2003 (32-bit version) that includes the installation of drivers for the
Intel PRO/100 and Intel PRO/1000 adapters.</p>
<p>	As part of the unattended installation, you can create teams. If you wish to
create one or more teams as part of the unattended installation, you must also
follow the instructions denoted in this page as &quot;Instructions for Creating
Teams (Optional)&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	For more information and instructions, see the pushws3.txt file in the
APPS\SETUP\PUSH\WS03XP32 directory on the Product CD.</p>
