<h2><a name="Multiple Adapters">Multiple Adapters</a></h2>
<p>When configuring a multi-adapter environment, you must upgrade all Intel
adapters in the computer to the latest software.
<p>If the computer has trouble detecting all adapters, consider the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">If you enable Wake On LAN (WOL) on more than two adapters,
    the Wake on LAN* (WOL) feature may overdraw your system’s auxiliary power
    supply, resulting in the inability to boot the system and other
    unpredictable problems. For multiple desktop/management adapters, it is
    recommended that you install one adapter at a time and use the IBAUtil
    utility (ibautil.exe in \APPS\BOOTAGNT) to disable the WOL feature on adapters
    that do not require WOL capabilities. On most server adapters, the WOL
    feature is disabled by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Adapters with Intel Boot Agent enabled will require a
    portion of the limited start up memory for each adapter enabled. Disable the
    service on adapters that do not need to boot PXE or RPL.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="PCI Common"></a>PCI and PCI-X Configuration Troubleshooting</h2>
<p CLASS="numlst">If the adapter is not recognized by your OS or if it does not
work you may need to change some BIOS Setup program settings. Try the following
only if you are having problems with the adapter.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">You may need to change the Plug and Play setting in your
    computer's BIOS. See your computer's manual for instructions on how to
    access.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="numlst">Enable the PCI slot. In some PCI computers, you may need to use the
    BIOS Setup program to enable the PCI slot.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="numlst"> You must install the
    network
    adapter in a bus master slot. Some BIOS Setup programs require you to enable the slot for
    bus master/master. Check your
    BIOS Setup program and the computer's documentation to make sure the slot is set for
    bus master/master.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="numlst">Configure the slot for level-triggered interrupts. The PCI slot the adapter is using must be configured for level-triggered interrupts instead of edge-triggered interrupts. Check your
    BIOS Setup program to make sure triggering is set up.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="numlst">Reserve interrupts and/or memory addresses into the BIOS. This prevents PCI cards from trying to use the same settings as ISA cards. Check your
    BIOS Setup program; there may be IRQ options such as Enable for ISA or Disable for PCI.</li>
</ul>
<P CLASS="Body-Text">
Here are some examples of BIOS Setup program parameters:
<blockquote>
<P CLASS="Figure-text">
<b>
PCI slot #</b>:	Slot where the adapter is installed (1-3)<br>
<b>Master</b>:	ENABLED<br>
<b>Slave</b>:	ENABLED<br>
<b>Latency timer</b>:	40 - 80<br>
<b>Interrupt</b>:	Choose any one of several that the BIOS Setup provides.<br>
<b>Edge-level</b>:	Level
