SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 8 IA64 cause unresolved symbols
============================================================

If you get unresolved symbol errors when loading the e1000 driver, perform
the following:

1. cd /usr/src/linux
2. make cloneconfig
3. make dep

Then rebuild the driver.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 warning message during driver build
==================================================================

While building the driver on SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 installations, the
following warning may be displayed. It is safe to ignore this message. The
driver will load and function normally.

Symbol version dump /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-7.69-obj/ia64/default/Module.symvers
is  missing, modules will have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled. 

Red Hat Linux 7.1
==================

  Creating an RPM from tar / zipped File
  --------------------------------------
  When trying to generate an RPM from the .tar.gz file, a segmentation fault 
  (core dump) occurs. This failure occurs because Red Hat Linux 7.1 uses 
  version 4.0.2 of the RPM utility. This version does not have the ability to 
  handle parameterized macros, which are used within the e100 and e1000 spec 
  files to generate an RPM. Updating the RPM utility to a more current version 
  resolves the issue. The utility can be obtained from http://www.rpm.org.

ACPI enable may cause Dual Port PRO/1000 Adapters to fail
=========================================================

  If ACPI is turned on in the kernel, dual port adapters may not work. 
  This is due to a limitation in ACPI. Currently, this affects all new 
  versions of SuSE.

Linux SNMP: Set operation fails on Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3
================================================================

  Running the set operation using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 fails when 
  using the net-snmp-5.0.8 package. This issue has been fixed in 
  net-snmp-5.0.9 package.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS Release 2.1 Distribution
=====================================================

  If there are errors while compiling the driver, do the following
  (step 3 is optional):

    1. cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.9-e.34
    2. run 'uname -r' to determine the configuration of the running
       kernel. example: 2.4.9	
    3. run 'uname -m' to determine the current machine/processor architecture.
       example: i686
    4. run 'uname -v' to determine the kernel configuration.
       example: #1 SMP Tue Jun 1 10:06:39 PDT 2004
    5. determine the appropriate config file from configs directory based 
       on steps 2 and 3.
       example: kernel-2.4.9-i686-smp.config
    6. copy the config file to the current directory as .config.
    7. run make {oldconfig | menuconfig}

  You can make changes to the kernel configuration, or accept the given values  
  and you must save the resulting configuration.

    8. edit the Makefile and fix the EXTRAVERSION to match the one from step 4.
    9. make dep
    10. return to the directory where the driver source is located and build 
       the driver, using instructions located in the readme file.

  While building the driver, ignore the warning:

     /lib/modules/2.4.9-e.34/build/include/linux/rhconfig.h:31:60:
     operator '(' has no left operand

  NOTE: If you have never built a Linux kernel before, we recommend visiting
  Red Hat's web site at www.redhat.com
