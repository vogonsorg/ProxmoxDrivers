A.  Folder Contents and Overview
=================================
This folder contains Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI Ver 3.0
for:
Microsoft* Windows NT* 4.0 with Service Pack 3 including NDIS HotFix 
  or with a subsequent Service Pack

This folder contains the MIF files your management software will
need to view in order to view the Intel(R) adapter functions.

The DMI 2.0 SP SDK v1.10 (Service Provider) setup program is located 
under APPS\DMI\SERVPROV on the CD. This must be installed or
Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI Version 3.0 will not work.
 
The DMI 2.0 Service Provider (SP) and Client Instrumentation 
3.0 for Windows (CI) are updated software modules that 
allow standards-based DMI 2.0 applications, 
including LANDesk Client Manager, to monitor the status 
of PCI adapters. The drivers included in this folder can be
used to view both single adapter information and custom information
including AFT/ALB Teaming, VLAN, and Flow Control. 

B. Software Requirements and Install File Locations
====================================================
The software requirements to run the Intel Client Instrumentation are:

- A Windows NT 4.0 based operating system.

- Any Intel NDIS PCI adapter driver. Intel Client Instrumentation 
supports all Intel PCI PRO/100, PRO/100+ and PRO/1000 adapters. 
If you are running an NDIS based driver under Windows NT 4.0, there 
is no need to install any new drivers to get DMI support. 

The Service Provider must be installed in order to use the Intel DMI
Instrumentation. However, the instrumentation may be installed either
before or after installing the Service Provider.  If you have a
Service Provider later than Version 2.0 already installed, you do not
need to install the Service Provider from this CD.

To install the Intel Client Instrumentation (this is not order dependent):
- Run \APPS\DMI\SERVPROV\SETUP.EXE (to install the Service Provider)
- Restart the system. This is required for the Service Provider to start.
- Run \APPS\DMI\WINNT4\INSTALL.EXE (to install the Client Instrumentation)

Contact your Network Administrator if you need help with installation.


C. Uninstall Procedure
======================
To properly uninstall the Client Instrumentation, the Service 
Provider software must still be running. Then go to
Add/Remove Software in the Windows Control Panel and select
"Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI" and click the
Remove button.
After Intel Client Instrumentation is gone from this list, you 
may remove the Service Provider software through the Start Programs 
menu. MIFs usually do not require removal, but if you should
wish to remove the Intel specific files, see the documentation
for your Management application.


D. Supported Standards
======================
The DMI instrumentation on this CD does not comply with the DMTF DMI 2.0 
standards.  For directions on how to install a DMI version which complies 
to the standards, go to the Intel Support web site at http://support.intel.com.

At this time there are no user SETs. There are sets in the 
IBM Failover Adapter Table Group that are required by the IBM 
Hotplug process but there is no user set allowed. 

Only the following events listed in the ni_nic.mif are currently supported:
- Cable unplugged/No LAN activity
- Adapter initialization failure
- AFT/ALB events (Adapter Fault Tolerance/Adaptive Load Balancing)


E. Known Issues
=============== 

1. Known Problems in Installation and Uninstallation Order:
a. Version 3.0 of the Intel Client Instrumentation may not install
   correctly over an existing Version 1.0 of the Intel DMI 
   Network Adapter Instrumentation Layer. The Uninstall feature may
   not work correctly after upgrading so please uninstall Ver 1.0
   BEFORE upgrading. In order to install Version 3.0 correctly, 
   please use the documented Uninstall procedures for Version 1.0.
       
b. If the TCP/IP protocol is removed after installing the Client 
   Instrumentation, you must reinstall the Client Instrumentation 
   again after you reinstall TCP/IP.

2. Enumeration of adapters, teams and VLANs takes place when the
   DMI instrumentation starts.  Hence, if teams or VLANs are added
   while the DMI instrumentation is running, the new teams or VLANs
   will not show up until the DMI instrumentation has been restarted.
