<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_Configuration</h2></font>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br>
This class is used to group a collection of IANet_Setting instances.  The class is derived from CIM_Configuration.

<p><b>Instances</b><br>
Each adapter, VLAN or Team can have several associated IANet_Configuration instances (each configuration corresponds to a different usage scenario for the adapter.

<p>For this WMI and CDM Providers release, there will be only one instance of IANet_Configuration per adapter, VLAN or team.

<p><b>Creating Instances</b><br>
You cannot create instances of IANet_Configuration.

<p><b>Removing Instances</b><br>
You cannot remove instances of IANet_Configuration.

<p><b>Modifying Properties</b><br>
There are no user-modifiable properties for this class.

<p><b>Associations</b><br>
An IANet_AdapterConfiguration instance will exist to associate each adapter (IANet_EthernetAdapter) with its configuration. An IANet_VLANConfiguration instance will exist to associate each VLAN (IANet_VLAN) with its configuration. An IANet_BootAgentConfiguration
instance will exist to associate each boot agent (IANet_BootAgent) with its configuration.

<p><b>Methods</b><br>
There are no supported methods for this class.

<p><b>Unsupported Attributes</b><br>
None.

<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_Setting</h2></font>

<p><b>Purpose</b><br>
This abstract class is used to describe a settable property in a configuration. The class is derived from CIM_Setting.

<p><b>Instances</b><br>
A separate instance of this class will exist for each setting on each adapter, VLAN or Team.  Settings are not shared between configurations. 

<p>There are several sub-classes for IANet_Setting. The sub-classes correspond to the different types and ranges of values that settings can take. Each sub-class corresponds to a different style of GUI that may be used to display or change the settings.

<p><b>Creating Instances</b><br>
You cannot create instances of IANet_Setting.

<p><b>Removing Instances</b><br>
You cannot remove instances of IANet_Setting.

<p><b>Modifying Properties</b><br>
This abstract class has no modifiable properties, however, the child classes have modifiable properties (see below).

<p><b>Associations</b><br>
Each IANet_Setting instance is associated with an IANet_Configuration instance using an instance of IANet_SettingContext.

<p><b>Methods</b><br>
There are no supported methods for this class.  To make changes to a setting, modify the required property and call <b>PutInstance</b>.

<p><b>Unsupported Attributes</b><br>
SettingID is not used.

<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_SettingInt</h2></font>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br>
This class models a setting that takes an integer value. There are several IANet setting classes used to model integers.  The differences between these classes
is related to the way the GUI displays and modifies the integer and
the way the Providers validate.  For IANet_SettingInt, it is expected that the GUI will display an edit box with a spin control.

<p><b>Instances</b><br>
An instance of this class exists for each setting that should be displayed as an integer edit box.  

<p><b>Creating Instances</b><br>
You cannot create instances of this class.  

<p><b>Removing Instances</b><br>
You cannot remove instances of this class.

<p><b>Modifying Properties</b><br>
The "CurrentValue" attribute is the only modifiable property of this class. You can modify this property by using <b>IWbemClassObject::Put()</b> to change the value, then call <b>IWbemServices::PutInstance()</b> to update the setting. The
Providers will check that:
<p><b>CurrentValue</b>  <=  <b>max</b><br>
<b>CurrentValue</b>  >=  <b>min</b><br>
(<b>CurrentValue</b> - <b>min</b>) is a multiple of <b>Step</b><br><br>
Where <b>max</b>, <b>min</b>, <b>CurrentValue</b> and <b>Step</b> are all attributes of IANet_SettingInt.

<p><b>Associations</b><br>
Each IANet_SettingInt instance is associated with an IANet_Configuration instance using an instance of IANet_SettingContext.

<p><b>Unsupported Attributes</b><br>
SettingID is not used.

<p><b>Methods</b><br>
There are no supported methods for this class. To make changes to a setting, modify the required property and call <b>PutInstance</b>.

<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_SettingEnum</h2></font>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br>
This class models a setting that takes an integer value. There are several IANet setting classes used to model integers.  The differences between these classes
is related to the way the GUI displays and modifies the integer and
the way the Providers validate. For IANet_SettingEnum, it is expected that the GUI will display a list of strings that map onto a small number of enumerated values (e.g., a drop list combo box).

<p><b>Instances</b><br>
An instance of this class exists for each setting that will be displayed as an enum. 

<p><b>Creating Instances</b><br>
You cannot create instances of this class.  

<p><b>Removing Instances</b><br>
You cannot remove instances of this class.

<p><b>Modifying Properties</b><br>
The <b>CurrentValue</b> attribute is the only modifiable property of this class. Modify this property by using <b>Put()</b> to change the value, then call <b>PutInstance()</b> to update the setting. The
Providers will check that <b>CurrentValue &#1028; PossibleValues[]</b>

<p><b>Associations</b><br>
Each IANet_SettingEnum instance is associated with an IANet_Configuration instance using an instance of IANet_SettingContext.

<p><b>Unsupported Attributes</b><br>
SettingID is not used.

<p><b>Methods</b><br>
There are no supported methods on this class.  To make changes to a setting, modify the required property and call <b>PutInstance</b>.

<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_SettingSlider</h2></font>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br>
This class models a setting that takes an integer value. There are several IANet setting classes used to model integers.  The differences between these classes
is related to the way the GUI displays and modifies the integer and
the way the Providers validate. For IANet_SettingSlider, it is expected that the GUI will display a slider that will allow you to choose the value in a graphical manner - the actual value chosen need not be displayed.

<p><b>Instances</b><br>
An instance of this class exists for each setting that will be displayed as a slider.  

<p><b>Creating Instances</b><br>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">IANet_SettingMultiSelection</h2></font>
