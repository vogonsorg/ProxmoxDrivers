Introduction

A "Push", or unattended installation of Windows 2000 provides a means for 
network administrators to easily install Windows 2000 on similarly equipped 
systems. The network administrator can create a bootable diskette that 
automatically logs into a central server and installs the operating system from 
an image of the Windows 2000 installation directory stored on that server. This 
document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation of 
Windows 2000 that includes the installation of drivers for the Intel(R) PRO/100 
and Intel(R) PRO/1000 adapters.

As part of the unattended installation, you can create teams and VLANs. If you 
wish to create one or more teams/VLANs as part of the unattended installation, 
you must also follow the instructions denoted in this page as "Instructions 
for Creating Teams/VLANs (Optional)".

The elements necessary for the Windows 2000 unattended installation are:

- A Windows 2000 Server with a shared image of the \I386 directory from the 
  Windows 2000 installation CD. 
- If you want to create teams/VLANs as part of the unattended installation, you 
  need to create a configuration file with the team information in it. To 
  create this file, you need a sample system that has the same type of adapters 
  that will be in the systems receiving the push installation. On the sample 
  system, use Intel(R) PROSet to set up the adapters in the teaming/VLAN 
  configuration you want. This system could also be the Windows 2000 Server 
  mentioned above. For clarity, this system is referred to in this page as the 
  configured system. 
- An unattended installation configuration file that provides Windows 2000 
  setup with information it needs to complete the installation. The name of 
  this file is UNATTEND.TXT. 

A DOS boot diskette that contains Microsoft Network Client software for 
connecting to the Windows 2000 server and AutoExec commands to 
automatically start the Windows 2000 installation. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up an install directory on the file server

The server must be setup with a distribution folder that holds the required 
Windows 2000 files and which clients can reach when connecting via TCP/IP or 
IPX.

For illustration purposes, the examples on this page use the network share 
D:\PUSH2K. To create this share, 

1) Create a directory on the server, (EX: D:\PUSH2K) and create an I386 
   directory beneath it.  
2) Use the My Computer applet in Windows 2000 to locate the D:\PUSH2K folder.  
3) Right-click the folder and select Sharing.  
4) Select Share this folder. Give it a share name (EX: PUSH2K). This share 
   name will be used to connect to this directory from the remote target 
   systems. 
5) By default, the permissions for this share will be for Everyone to have 
   Full Control.  
5) Adjust permissions as necessary and click OK.  

To prepare the distribution folder:

1) Copy the \I386 folder from the Windows 2000 CD to D:\PUSH2K. Use Windows 
   Explorer or XCOPY to maintain the same directory structure as on the 
   Windows 2000 CD. When the copy is complete, the Windows 2000 installation 
   files should be in the D:\PUSH2K\I386 directory. 
2) Copy Unattend.txt from the Intel CD (found in \APPS\SETUP\PUSH\WIN2K) into 
   the shared directory D:\PUSH2K\I386.  
3) Edit the Unattend.txt file with Notepad or another text-editor to include 
   your customizations. At a minimum you should change the items in the 
   [UserData] section of the file.   For server installations the [LicenseFilePrintData] section
   should be used to specify the server type and number of users (for PerServer type).
4) Create the driver install directory structure and copy the driver files 
   to it. 

NOTE: The PUSHCOPY.BAT file provided with the drivers in the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH 
directory copies the appropriate files for the installation. PUSHCOPY also 
copies the components needed to perform the automated installations contained 
in the [GuiRunOnce] section of the sample UNATTEND.TXT file. These include an 
unattended installation of the Intel PROSet configuration and diagnostic 
utility. 

Example: From a Windows 2000 command prompt where e: is the drive letter of 
the CD-ROM drive:
e: 
cd \APPS\SETUP\PUSH 
	(you must be in the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH\ directory to run PUSHCOPY)
pushcopy D:\PUSH2K\I386 w2k

The above command creates the $OEM$ directory structure and copies all the 
necessary files to install the driver and Intel PROSet. However, Intel PROSet 
is not  installed unless the line:

; Command0="c:\drivers\net\Intel\Proset.msi/qn" is 
uncommented from unattend.txt.

As an alternative to using the PUSHCOPY.BAT file method the following steps 
can be used to create the required directory structure for unattended 
installation of the Intel PRO/1000 and Intel PRO/100 drivers. Note that this 
method does not copy the files specified in the [GuiRunOnce] section of the 
sample UNATTEND.TXT. If this method is used, the entries in this section 
should be commented out.

Make folders beneath the new \i386 as follows:

\$OEM$\$$\System32
\$OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\Intel

From the files provided with the Intel adapter run (from the makedisk 
directory):
"makedisk w2k Z:\PUSH2K\i386\$OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\Intel"

Alternative: run "makedisk\makedisk w2k a:" where a: is the floppy and then 
copy the contents of the floppy into 
Z:\PUSH2K\i386\$OEM$\$1\Drivers\Net\Intel.
Use Xcopy /s or Windows Explorer to maintain the proper directory structure.

See the "Directory structure for unattended installation files" section of
this document for more information about the directory structure and file 
layout of the $OEM$ directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for Creating Teams/VLANs (Optional)

1) Copy SavRes.vbs from the Intel CD to the configured system. The file is 
   located in the APPS\WMI\ directory on the Intel CD. 
2) Open a command prompt on the configured system and navigate to the 
   directory containing SavRes.vbs. 
3) Run the following command: cscript SavRes.vbs save. A configuration file 
   called WmiConf.txt is created in the same directory. 
4) On the Windows 2000 Server, create a directory in the $OEM$\$1 directory 
   called WMIScr. For example, on Windows 2000, the directory is 
   $OEM$\$1\WMIScr. 
5) Copy the SavRes.vbs and WmiConf.txt files to the WMIScr directory. 
6) Edit the GUIRunOnce section in the unattend.txt file in the following way. 
   After the command to install Intel PROSet and the drivers, add the 
   following command:  

   Command1="%systemroot%\system32\cmd.exe /c cscript c:\wmiscr\savres.vbs restore c:\wmiscr\wmiconf.txt > c:\wmiscr\output.txt"



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment Methods

Make sure that you have a copy of a network bootable MS-DOS floppy that will 
connect to the Z:\PUSH2K directory, use it to boot the destination system 
(the one you want to push install to), and connect to this shared network 
directory.

Run the command at the \\Server\PUSH2K\i386 prompt: 
	winnt /u:Z:\I386\unattend.txt /s:Z:\I386 /t:c 
where Z: equals mapped drive.

If you installed teams/VLANs as part of the unattended installation, view the 
results of the script execution in the output.txt file. This file is in 
the same directory as the SavRes.vbs file.

NOTE: In the above procedure, setup runs the installation in unattended 
mode and also detects the plug and play network adapters. All driver files 
are copied from the shared directory to the target system directories and 
installation of the OS and Network Adapters continues without user 
intervention.

Directory structure for unattended installation files

The following directory structure is created by PUSHCOPY.BAT to place the files 
necessary for the installation of the driver and PROSet. The directory D:\PUSH2K 
refers to the location of the files from the \I386 directory on the Windows 2000 
installation CD.
