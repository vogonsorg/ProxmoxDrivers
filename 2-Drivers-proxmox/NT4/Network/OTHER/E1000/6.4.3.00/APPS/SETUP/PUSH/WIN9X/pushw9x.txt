Operating system support for Intel PRO/1000 T Desktop Adapters

The drivers for the Intel PRO/1000 T Desktop Adapter are supported only for 
Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows Me edition. Windows 98 Retail does not 
support the NDIS 5 driver.

Computer names in Microsoft networks
There cannot be more than one computer with a particular name on the network at 
any time, even during installation. Consequently to deploy Windows 98/Me on 
multiple computers, you must manually change the value of the computer name.

Different configuration managers exist to overcome this hurdle in enterprise OS 
deployments. For more information on deploying Windows 98/Me in an enterprise 
network, consult the Windows 98 resource kit.

Setting up an install directory on the file server

NOTE: The network share Z:\PUSH noted in this section is an example path to the 
distribution folder. The distribution folder is where the Windows setup files 
(Setup.exe and .CAB files) reside. During the first step of the install, the 
client connects to the distribution folder with IPX or TCP/IP. 

Before an unattended server based setup of Windows can occur, you must prepare 
a directory.

Copy the Windows setup folder from the Windows CD to Z:\PUSH. Use Explorer, 
Winfile or XCOPY to maintain the same directory structure as on the CD. 
Use the pushcopy.bat batch file located in the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH directory on the 
Intel CD to copy the necessary files to Z:\PUSH or alternatively copy the entire 
Intel CD to Z:\PUSH.
  
NOTE: PUSHCOPY.BAT must be run from the \APPS\SETUP\PUSH directory on the CD or 
CD image.
 
The command to copy the Windows 98 files or Windows Me to the Z:\PUSH directory 
is: PUSHCOPY Z:\PUSH W9X.

By default, pushcopy.bat copies all files required to install the driver and 
Intel PROSet II. Intel PROSet II is installed during the push installation. 
Comment out the following line in the [RunOnce.BatchDelay] section if you do 
not to install Intel PROSet II.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER,%KEY_RUNONCE%,BatchRun0,,"c:\progra~1\Intel\proset.exe 
MsiPath=c:\Progra~1\Intel /qn"
 
Review the copy of MSBATCH.INF within the Z:\PUSH directory. Make any changes 
needed to customize the install. At a minimum you should change the 
ProductKey= entry in the [Setup] section, the Name= and Org= entries in 
the [NameAndOrg] section, and the ComputerName= entry in the [Network] 
section.
 
NOTE: Make sure that you read the comments in the [RunOnce.BatchDelay] 
section and uncomment the appropriate batch commands for your installation.

Deployment Methods

There are many ways to perform an unattended installation or upgrade including 
but not limited to:

- Setting up a login script that executes a setup statement when each user 
  logs in. 
- Inserting an object in an email message that runs setup when the user clicks 
  it. 
- Using Microsoft SMS server to run Windows Setup 
- Inserting a floppy that shares a drive on the network and runs setup from 
  the shared drive 
- Copying the files to a local drive and then running an unattended setup from 
  there. 
- Use the Boot Strap Agent and an installed PXE Server. See the Boot Agent 
  Users Guide for deployment suggestions and strategies for each OS. 

Use the method that best suits your network situation.

To avoid possible areas where an unattended installation might be halted, use 
one of the following setup command lines for Windows 98 or Windows Me 
respectively:

Windows 98:
SETUP /IS /ID /IM /IE /IW
- "/IV" turns off billboards and speeds up the setup.
- "/ID" turns off free diskspace check

Windows Me:
SETUP /IS /ID /IM /IE /IW /IV

NOTE: Do not include the argument "/ID" if you believe that there is 
insufficient free hard disk space.

Where to get help

The Windows Resource kits contains detailed information on unattended setups and 
deploying Windows 98 in an enterprise environment.
