OVERVIEW
========

Intel's diagnostic software lets you test the adapter to see if there are
any problems with the adapter hardware, the cabling, or the network
connection. You can also use diagnostics to isolate problems during
troubleshooting.  DIAGS is a single program that operates identically
under multiple operating systems.

These utilities are designed to test hardware operation and confirm the
adapter's ability to communicate with another adapter in the same network,
primarily confirming cabling. They should not be used to judge performance.

They can test the adapter whether or not there is a responder on the network.
In order to do a thorough test, however, you should set-up a second system on
the network as a responder prior to starting a test.
