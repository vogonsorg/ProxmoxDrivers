OVERVIEW
--------

The Intel PCI NIC Identification Utility identifies Intel PCI adapters
and provides adapter properties and assigned resources. You can readily
use this information in batch, script and configuration files for
automation purposes.

The utility returns the following values:

- Slot number. PCI slot number reported by the adapter; returned in decimal
  format.
- SLOTX. PCI slot number reported by the adapter; For Gigabit solutions it is
  returned in hexidecimal format.
- PCI device ID. Adapters sharing the same PCI device ID can use the same
  driver. See the table at the end of this document showing the
  relationship between drivers and PCI device IDs.
- SSID - PCI Subsystem ID and the Subvendor ID displayed in hexidecimal.
- MAC address. 12-digit Ethernet ID assigned to the adapter. This number
  is also printed on the adapter label.
- Revision ID.  Adapters with the same device ID may be distinguished with 
  the revision ID.

RUNNING THE UTILITY
-------------------

To run IDADAPT.EXE, you must start the computer in DOS. This utility
should not be run from a DOS session within any version of Microsoft
Windows*, or in any other non-DOS operating system.

IDADAPT.EXE can be run with no command line options, or with either of the
following command line options:

	/?
	Displays help information

	/B:<filename>
	Creates a file containing the adapter properties with the name
	specified. This file is in the format of a DOS batch file. If this
	file is named with the extension of .BAT, it can be executed as a
	batch file. Executing this batch file will create environment
	variables from the adapter properties.

	/VERSION
        Displays IDADAPT version information and the diagnostic library version
        information.

USAGE NOTES
-----------

Running the utility with no command line parameters displays the adapter
properties on the screen. For example, if you enter IDADAPT in a computer
with 2 Intel PCI adapters installed, the display would resemble the
following:
NIC1 SLOT=43 SLOTX=0068 PCI ID=1229 SSID=10118086 MAC=0002B31FE072 RevID=65
NIC2 SLOT=47 SLOTX=0069 PCI ID=1031 SSID=10118086 MAC=0090270AAF73 RevID=32

In this example, the first adapter has the following properties:
- Logical slot is 43
- SLOTX is 0068
- PCI device ID is 1229
- SSID is 10118086
- MAC address is 0002B31FE072
- The revision ID is 65

If the utility does not find any adapters, it reports "No supported
adapters were found" and returns an error level of 1. You can use the
error level for conditional branching in batch files.

If you run the utility using /B:<filename>, it creates a file with the
name you specified. This file contains adapter properties in a batch
file format. This is an example batch file:
SET NIC1_SLOT=43
SET NIC1_SLOTX=0068
SET NIC1_PCIID=1229
SET NIC1_SSID=10118086
SET NIC1_MAC=0002B31FE072
SET NIC1_REVID=65
SET NIC2_SLOT=47
SET NIC2_SLOTX=0069
SET NIC2_PCIID=1031
SET NIC2_SSID=10118086
SET NIC2_MAC=0090270AAF73
SET NIC2_REVID=32

If the name you assign to the file ends in .BAT, it can be executed in DOS.
Executing the file sets environment variables for each property of each
adapter.

Once the environment variables are created by the batch file, you can
insert the values into configuration files as needed. See examples below.

When using this batch file, remember that about 64 bytes of environment
space will be needed for each adapter found. Insure that you make
sufficient environment space available in your configuration.

EXAMPLES
---------

1
-
To create a startup disk that loads a Packet Driver named PCKTDRVR.COM
on the second found NIC, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file might contain the following:
IDADAPT /B:INTELSET.BAT
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO NO_NIC
CALL INTELSET.BAT
PCKTDRVR 0x60 %NIC2_SLOT%
GOTO END
:NO_NIC
ECHO NO ADAPTER FOUND!!
PAUSE
:END

2
-
To create a startup disk that automatically detects the adapter model
and loads the proper DOS ODI driver, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file might contain
the following:
IDADAPT /B:INTELSET.BAT
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO NO_NIC
CALL INTELSET.BAT
LSL
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1229" GOTO PRO100
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "2449" GOTO PRO100
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1000" GOTO PRO1000
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1001" GOTO PRO1000
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1002" GOTO PRO1000
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1003" GOTO PRO1000
IF "%NIC1_PCIID%" == "1004" GOTO PRO1000
GOT0 NO_NIC
:PRO100
E100BODI
GOTO CONTINUE
:PRO1000
E1000ODI
GOTO CONTINUE
:CONTINUE
IPXODI
VLM /V4
GOTO END
:NO_NIC
ECHO !! NO SUITABLE ADAPTER FOUND !!
PAUSE
:END


LIMITATIONS
-----------

This utility is designed to work with Intel PCI adapters. It
should work with any modern Intel PCI bus adapter, as well as LAN on
Motherboard designs based on Intel 10/100 and 10/100/1000 silicon.

It does not work with any Intel CardBus, PCMCIA, ISA, EISA or MCA bus
adapters, or obsolete (products released prior to 1996) Intel network
adapters of any architecture.

IDADAPT.EXE will detect and return information on a maximum of sixteen
adapters in a computer.
