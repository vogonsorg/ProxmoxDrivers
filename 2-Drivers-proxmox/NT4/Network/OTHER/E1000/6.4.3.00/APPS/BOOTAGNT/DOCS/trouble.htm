<h2><a name="issues"></a>Common Issues</h2>
<P>
The following list of problems and associated solutions covers a representative set of problems 
that you might encounter while using the Boot Agent.
If you are experiencing a problem that is not listed in this section, contact
<a target="_blank" href="http://support.intel.com">Intel Customer Support</a> either 
by telephone or over the World Wide Web.</P>

<h4><i>After booting, my computer experiences problems</i></h4>
<P>
After the Boot Agent product has finished its sole task (remote booting), it no longer 
has any effect on the client computer operation.
Thus, any issues that arise after the boot process is complete are most likely
not related to the Boot Agent product.</P>
<P>
If you are having problems with the local (client) or network operating system, contact 
the operating system manufacturer for assistance. If you are having problems with some 
application program, contact the application manufacturer for assistance. If you are 
having problems with any of your computer's hardware or with the
<a href="glossary.htm#BIOS">BIOS</a>, contact your computer system manufacturer for
assistance.</P>

<h4><i>Cannot change boot order</i></h4>
<P>
If you are accustomed to redefining your computer's boot order using the
motherboard BIOS setup program, the default settings of the Boot Agent setup program can 
override that setup. To change the boot sequence, you must first override the Boot Agent 
setup program defaults. To start the Boot Agent
configuration setup program, press <b>Ctrl+S</b> during the time the initialization
message appears. (<b>Ctrl+S</b> is not available on many LOM systems, including
Dell.) A configuration setup menu appears allowing you to set
configuration values for the Boot Agent. If you do not press <b>Ctrl+S</b>, the Boot Agent 
software proceeds with the boot process, eventually bringing up the
operating system. To change your computer's boot order setting, see
<a href="config.htm#pxe_rpl">Configuring the Boot Agent in a Pre-boot PXE or RPL Environment</a>.
</P>

<h4><i>Flash device wrong size</i></h4>
<P>
This can occur as an error message when using <a href="dos_util.htm">IBAUtil</a>. The 
full version of Boot Agent software cannot be loaded into a flash ROM device smaller than 
64 KB. If a 32 KB (or smaller) flash ROM device is detected in the adapter, the
flash update software returns this message. Assuming the device is
socketed, remove the &quot;too small&quot; device and install a blank 64 KB (or larger) 
flash ROM device. See <a href="hw_inst.htm#flash_wfm_adapters">Installing Flash ROM
Upgrades</a> for more information.</P>

<h4><i>My computer does not complete POST</i></h4>
<P>
If your computer fails to boot with an adapter installed, but <i>does</i> boot
when you remove the adapter, try moving the adapter to another computer and <a href="dos_util.htm#Example 3:">using
IBAUtil to disable the flash chip</a>.</P>
<P>If this does not work, the problem may be occurring before the Boot Agent
software even begins operating. In this case, there may be a BIOS problem with
your computer. Contact your computer manufacturer's customer support group for
help in correcting your problem.</P>
<h4>
<i>
Not getting a prompt to go to Boot Agent setup program</i></h4>
<P>
This is actually a feature of the Boot Agent product. As part of the Boot
Agent's Configuration Setup Program, two of the options, Show Setup Prompt and
Setup Wait Time, allow the boot process to proceed after <a href="glossary.htm#POST">POST</a>
without interruption by the Ctrl+S prompt as follows:</P>

<blockquote>
	<pre>Press Ctrl+S to enter the Setup Menu.</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>
If the Show Setup Prompt has previously been set to <b>Disabled</b>
and/or if the Setup Menu Wait Time option is set to zero seconds, the prompt
does not display after POST. However, even though you are not prompted to press 
<b>Ctrl+S</b>, you can still enter the Configuration Setup Menu to customize
configuration settings as follows:</P>
<p class="numlst">Repeatedly press <b> Ctrl+S</b> <i>immediately</i>
after POST until the Configuration Setup Menu appears.</p>

<TABLE border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <TD valign="top" width="28"><img border="0" src="note.gif" width="28" height="21"></TD>
    <TD valign="top"><B><I>NOTE</I>:</B> If the Configuration Setup Menu does not appear after repeated pressings
      of <b>Ctrl+S</b>, you were likely not fast enough. In this case, reboot and try
      again. (<b>Ctrl+S</b> is not available on many LOM systems, including
      Dell.)</TD>
  </tr>
</TABLE>

<p class="numlst">&nbsp;While in the Configuration Setup
Menu, you can restore the prompt message as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">If Show Setup Prompt has been set to <b>Disabled</b>,
    change it to <b>Enabled</b>.<br>
    --and/or--</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">If Setup Menu Wait Time is set to zero
    seconds, change it to any of the wait time values that exceed zero seconds.
    See the list of possible Set Menu Wait Time values shown in the
    <a href="config.htm#settings">Boot
    Agent Configuration Settings table</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>There are configuration/operation problems with the boot process</i></h4>
<P>
If your PXE client receives a DHCP address, but then fails to boot, you know the
PXE client is working correctly. Check your network or PXE server configuration
to troubleshoot the problem. Contact
<a target="_blank" href="http://support.intel.com">Intel Customer Support</a> 
if you need further assistance.</P>

<h2><a name="diag_pxe_rpl"></a>Diagnostics Information for Pre-boot PXE or RPL Environments</h2>
<p>Anytime the configuration setup menu is displayed (see
<a href="config.htm#pxe_rpl">Configuring
the Boot Agent in a Pre-boot PXE or RPL Environment</a>), you may press the <b>D</b> 
key to display <i>diagnostics</i> information on the screen. The information
displayed appears similar to that shown in the lower half of the screen image
below. This information can be helpful during interaction with
<a target="_blank" href="http://support.intel.com">Intel Customer Support</a> 
personnel or your IT team members. Once you press the <b>D</b> key, the
information displayed remains until you reboot your computer.</p>
