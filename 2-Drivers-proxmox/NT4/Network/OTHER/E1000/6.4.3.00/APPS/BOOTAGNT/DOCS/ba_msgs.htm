This can occur as an error message when using IBAUtil. The full version of Boot Agent software 
cannot be loaded into a flash ROM device smaller than 64 KB. If a 32 KB (or smaller) flash ROM 
device is detected in the adapter, the
flash update software returns this message. Assuming the device is
socketed, remove the &quot;too small&quot; device and install a blank 64 KB (or larger) flash ROM device.
