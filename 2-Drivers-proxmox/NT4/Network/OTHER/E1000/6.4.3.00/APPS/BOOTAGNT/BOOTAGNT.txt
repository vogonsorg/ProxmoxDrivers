Introduction
------------

The Intel Boot Agent is a software product that allows your networked
client computer to boot using a program code image supplied by a
remote server. PC vendors can implement the Intel Boot Agent to
accommodate various environments and protocols. 

Implementation support for the Boot Agent includes:

• Multi-protocol boot ROM(Read Only Memory) code designed for remote booting
from Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet Adapters, as well as LOM, or 
LAN on Motherboard implementations

• Complies with the Pre-boot eXecution Environment(PXE) Version 2.0, also 
called PXE 2.0 and 2.1 Specification

• Some versions of the Boot Agent also include support for Remote
Program Load (RPL) runtime and loader software


Some important Features offered by the Intel Boot Agent are:

• Same user interface for Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet Adapters

• Compliant with the Wired for Management Baseline 2.0 (WfM 2.0)
specification

• Compatible with legacy boot agent environments that use BOOTP
protocol

• Customizable in pre-boot, Windows*, and DOS environments

For more detailed information, refer to the Intel Boot Agent
online user's guide.


Installing the Boot Agent Software
----------------------------------

Most Intel WfM-compatible adapters, such as the Intel PRO/100 S
Desktop Adapter or the Intel PRO/1000 T Desktop Adapter, have a
factory-installed, integrated flash ROM device that has been
pre-programmed with a Boot Agent software image. However, you may
still wish to configure the Boot Agent Software. To do so, see the
Intel Boot Agent online user guide.

NOTE: The Intel PRO/1000 XT Server Adapter flash ROM can be enabled if
needed using the IBAUTIL utility.

In the event that you wish to install flash ROM in an adapter that has
an empty socket (Intel PRO/100 adapters only), access the list of
compatible flash ROM devices that are compatible with the Intel Boot
Agent from Intel's support website as follows:

1. Access Intel Customer Support's website at
http://support.intel.com.

2. Click the Search button.

3. Enter Boot Agent as your search string, and indicate that you want
to search through all types of documents.

4. Click Intel Boot Agent - Top Technical Issues to select the Boot
Agent Home page.

5. Click How do I get a Boot ROM for the Intel PRO/100B or PRO/100+
adapters that only come with a socket?

In cases involving hardware upgrades, once a flash ROM device is
available within the client computer, a valid Boot Agent software
image must be installed onto the flash ROM device. The way in which
the Boot Agent software image is installed within the flash ROM depends
upon your hardware configuration.

• If your computer includes the network adapter on its motherboard,
the Boot Agent software will need to be available as part of a
motherboard BIOS. Contact your computer or motherboard manufacturer
to upgrade your motherboard BIOS code. Alternatively, it is possible
that the motherboard has a ROM socket with a 64 KB (or larger) flash
ROM device. In this case, contact the motherboard manufacturer to get
the code that must be loaded into the flash ROM.

• If your computer uses a flash ROM-equipped adapter, use one of the
following procedures to install or update the Boot Agent software:

  - Installing/Updating in DOS Environments

  - Installing/Updating in Windows Environments Using Intel PROSet II


Installing/Updating the Boot Agent in DOS Environments
-------------------------------------------------------

Perform the following steps to install the Boot Agent software in a
DOS environment:

1. The following operation requires use of a DOS-bootable floppy disk
containing an executable image of the IBAUTIL.EXE utility. If you do
not have IBAUTIL.EXE on your DOS bootable floppy disk, copy it to your
system disk from the CD ROM that came with your product under the
\BOOTAGNT directory, or acquire the most up-to-date version from
Intel's website at http://support.intel.com.

2. Using your DOS bootable floppy disk, boot your computer to a DOS
prompt.

CAUTION: The next several steps require that your computer be booted
only to DOS, and not from a Windows "DOS box". These steps cannot be
performed from a DOS Command Prompt window or using a DOS task within
Windows.

NOTE: If the flash ROM device installed in the adapter ROM socket is
already programmed (not blank), you may need to take steps to enable
your computer to boot from the floppy drive. If necessary, disable the
network boot function from either the BIOS Setup program or the Boot
Agent's configuration setup menu. Then, reboot to the DOS bootable
floppy disk containing the IBAUTIL utility that you just prepared.

3. Type IBAUTIL -up and press Enter.

The following message appears showing a list of all compatible network
adapters found in your system, assuming both the adapter and the flash
ROM device are properly installed:

IBAUTIL vx.xx - Intel PCI NIC BOOT FLASH Update Utility
Copyright (C) 1995 - 2003  Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.

NIC Network Address   PWA Number   Series  FLASH Memory      Size  Valid
=== ================= ============ ======  ================= ====  =====
 1    00D0B7D36018     748565-005   1229   SST 39VF512        64   Yes

 2    000347003E35     A19845-003   1004   ATMEL AT49LV040   512   Yes
 
Select NIC to update or ESC to quit:

4. Type the number that corresponds to the Ethernet address of the
desired adapter to continue. The next question appears:

Select Option (U)pdate or (R)estore:

5. Type U (Update) if you want the IBAUTIL utility to update the flash
ROM device with the current version of Boot Agent software. Type R
(Restore) if you want IBAUTIL to write a previously stored flash image
file onto the flash ROM device.

NOTE: As part of the Update operation, IBAUTIL creates a backup file on
the floppy disk. Make sure that the write-enable tab on the floppy
disk is properly set. Also, prior to the Restore operation, make sure
that a flash image file is available in the same directory as the
IBAUTIL utility. This file will have an automatically generated filename
with a .FLS extension.

If you select the U (Update) response, this prompt appears:

Create Restore Image? (Y)es or (N)o:

6. Type Y (yes) to create a backup of the current contents of the
flash ROM device (not yet updated) onto a file. If such a file already
exists, you'll be asked if you want to overwrite the file. If you type
Y (yes), the flash image file is overwritten with the current contents
of the flash ROM. The new Boot Agent image is then written into the
flash ROM device used by the adapter. The process takes approximately
one minute. 

NOTE: The IBAUTIL utility automatically names the flash image file
(backup file) as XXXXXXXX.FLS, where XXXXXXXX are the last eight
digits of the adapter's Ethernet address. So, if you selected 1 (the
first NIC listed) in step 4 above, the backup file's name would be
B7D36018.FLS.

--or--

Type N (no) to cause IBAUTIL to proceed without first saving a copy of
the current contents of the flash ROM device onto a file. IBAUTIL asks
you to confirm your choice as follows:

Continue Update without Restore Image? (Y)es or (N)o:

If you type N (no), IBAUTIL cancels the update, leaving the flash
contents unchanged, and then asks you whether you want to reboot or
return to the DOS prompt. If you type Y (yes), a new Boot Agent image
is written into the flash ROM device used by the adapter. The process
takes approximately one minute, and then IBAUTIL prompts you with the
following question: 

Press <Enter> to reboot your computer, <Q> to quit without reboot.

7. Either press Enter to reboot or Q to return to the DOS prompt
without rebooting.


Updating the Boot Agent in Windows Environments
-------------------------------------------------
For instructions on updating the Boot Agent in a Windows environment,
refer to the online Intel Boot Agent User's Guide.


Configuration Setup
-------------------

The Intel Boot Agent software provides configuration options that
allow you to customize the behavior of the Boot Agent software.
Changing the Boot Agent configuration will usually be required only
the first time you add a new network adapter to a client computer
within your network.

The Boot Agent supports PXE and RPL configuration in pre-boot, Windows,
and DOS environments. In each of these environments, a single user interface
allows you to configure the Boot Agent from a PXE and RPL BIOS on both
Fast Ethernet and Gigabit adapters. 

For instructions on configuring the Boot Agent for the desired
environment, refer to the following sections within the Intel Boot
Agent User's Guide:

• Configuring the Boot Agent in a Pre-Boot Environment

• Configuring the Boot Agent in a Windows Environment

• Configuring the Boot Agent in a DOS Environment


Auxiliary DOS Utilities
-----------------------

The Intel PROSet II configuration and diagnostic utility requires use
of the Windows operating environment. For systems without Windows,
Intel provides utilities for installing and configuring the Boot Agent
using the DOS environment. These utilities include:

• The IBAUTIL utility backs up the current flash ROM image to a file and
copies a new Boot Agent image file into the flash ROM using a
simplified, menu-based user interface.

• The IBACFG provides an alternative means for modifying the
adapter configuration settings.

The above utilities are available on Intel Customer Support's web
site. These utilities are also located on the CD-ROM in the directory:

\BOOTAGNT

For additional information about using these utilities, refer to the
Auxiliary DOS Utilities section of the Intel Boot Agent User's
Guide.

NOTE: These utilities should be run from a DOS startup disk and not
from within Windows. Operation when Windows is loaded may be
unreliable.

CAUTION: If you use a third-party (non-Intel) boot ROM solution with
an Intel adapter and run Intel Boot Agent utilities, you may corrupt
the contents of your flash ROM, rendering it useless.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Once installed, the Boot Agent product has very few potential areas
where problems can arise. For a list of potential problems that you
might encounter while using the Boot Agent, as well as corrective
actions, refer to the Troubleshooting Procedures section of the
Intel Boot Agent User's Guide.
