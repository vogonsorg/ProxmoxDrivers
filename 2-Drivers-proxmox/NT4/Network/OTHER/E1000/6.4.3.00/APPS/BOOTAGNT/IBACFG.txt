the computer booted to DOS only.  This utility cannot be run in a DOS window
in any Microsoft* Windows product or in DOS compatibility mode in IBM* OS/2.

2. Insert a CD-ROM or floppy diskette containing the IBACfg.exe
utility.

3. Make the directory containing IBACfg.exe the current directory.

        IBACfg

A list of NICs is displayed.

press Enter to continue.

The Configuration Setup Menu is displayed. This menu shows a list of
configuration settings on the left and their corresponding values on the
right. Key descriptions near the bottom of the menu indicate how to
change setting values. For each selected setting, a brief "mini-Help"
description of its function also appears near the bottom of the menu.

6. Select the setting you want to change by pressing the up/down arrow
keys to highlight the setting. Press Enter to display a list of possible
values for the setting.

7. Select the value you want by pressing the up/down arrow keys to
