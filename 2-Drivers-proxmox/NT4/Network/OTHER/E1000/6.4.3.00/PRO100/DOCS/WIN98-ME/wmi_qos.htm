<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The Intel<sup>&nbsp; </sup>PRO Quality of Service (QoS) Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) Provider is a set of software modules that
allow WMI-based management applications to manage the QoS
capabilities of Intel<sup> </sup>PRO network adapters. QoS WMI Provider
uses WMI, an instrumentation technology for the
Microsoft Windows platform. 

<p>WMI is the middleware layer that allows measurement and
instrumentation information to be collected from kernel mode
data providers. This information is then provided to local or
remote user-mode data consumers through the use of a common set
of interfaces (Web-based Enterprise Management called WBEM). WMI
is a data-independent pipeline between the data consumer and
the data provider that makes no assumptions about the format
of the data. 

<p>The QoS WMI Provider lets WMI-aware management applications
set up priority filters to process high priority network
traffic before normal traffic. By prioritizing traffic at the
host or entry point of the network, network devices can base
forwarding decisions on priority information defined in the
packet. 

<p>WMI-aware management applications using QoS WMI Provider
functionality can configure priority filters on the target
system to do the following: 

<ul>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">Tag packets with priority levels for forwarding behaviors. 

  </li>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">Drop incoming packets that match certain criteria. 

  </li>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">Obtain statistics such as number of packets or number of bytes
that were tagged with a particular priority. 

  </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>The WMI Core components are part of the operating system. These
pieces are required for a WMI-enabled application to work.

<p>The QoS WMI Provider supports all Intel PCI PRO 10/100 adapters except
for 82557 based adapters.

<p>The QoS WMI Provider does not support any PRO 1000 adapters.

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>To install QoS WMI Provider, double-click on the setup program found in the 
&quot;\APPS\WBEM\WIN9X\QOS&quot; for Windows 98 or the “\APPS\WBEM\WINNT4\QOS” for Windows 
NT directory on the Intel CD. WMI Core components must be installed before QoS 
WMI Provider is installed. If QoS WMI Provider does not find the WMI Core 
component's registry keys, installation fails. If Microsoft WMI Core is not 
installed, install it and restart the QoS WMI Provider installer. </p>

<p>The most recently released version of Microsoft WMI Core can be
downloaded from: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a>

<h1><a name="Usage with Applications">Usage with Applications</a></h1>

<p>WMI-based management applications such as WBEM CIM studio and WBEM
Object browser in the WMI SDK can be used to access QoS WMI Provider 
functionality both locally and remotely. This applies to Windows NT 4.0 (SP4 and 
later).<p>On Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows Millennium operating systems.&nbsp; 
You must
carefully configure client systems to allow remote access of QoS WMI
Provider functionality.

<p>To do this, you will need to edit the Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows Millennium
system registry to remotely access QoS WMI Provider functionality.

serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating

  <li>
<p class="numlst">Open regedit (Start-Run-regedit) on the Windows 95, Windows 98 system, and ensure
that the following values are set correctly.

<h2><a name="Supported Standards">Supported Standards</a></h2>

<p>The QoS WMI Provider implements the CIM specification that was
submitted to DMTF for adoption into CIM 2.4 specification.

<h2><a name="Known Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">Under some circumstances, the process winmngt.exe may not start
on a Windows 95, 98 or Millennium system. This results in a browsing
machine being unable to connect to the Windows machine.
The browser (CIM Studio or other) may show an error &quot;the RPC server
is unavailable&quot;. If pview95.exe shows that winmngt.exe is not
executing, double click the file to begin execution. This may be&nbsp;
fixed permanently by upgrading to a newer version of the WBEM core.

  </li>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">All WBEM classes share the same access. There is currently no method to
define per-class security. Therefore, it is not possible to restrict
access to the QoS provider without restricting access to all WBEM classes.
Consult Microsoft's WBEM/WMI documentation for information on setting
appropriate security.

  </li>
  <li>
<p class="numlst">It is possible to create filters that conflict. For example, adding the
same filter with two different names will cause one filter to be ignored.
Ensure that any filters added will not conflict with existing filters.

  </li>
