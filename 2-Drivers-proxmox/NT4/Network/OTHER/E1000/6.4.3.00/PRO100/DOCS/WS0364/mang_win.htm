<h1>Remote Wake-Up and Wake-On-LAN (WOL)</h1>
<h2><b>Microsoft* Windows Products
</b></h2>
<p>Microsoft* Windows NT* and Windows
95 are not ACPI-capable. Some settings are not available in these operating
systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 98, Windows Me,
Windows 2000, Windows XP*, and Windows Server 2003 for 32-bit systems are ACPI-capable. These operating systems do not
support wake from S5 state, only from standby. When shutting down the system,
they shutdown ACPI devices including the Intel PRO adapters. This
disarms the adapters remote wake up capability. However, in some ACPI-capable
computers, the BIOS may have a setting that allows you to override the OS and
wake from an S5 state anyway. If there is no support for wake from S5 state in
your BIOS settings, you are limited to Wake From Standby when using
these operating systems in ACPI computers.</p>
<p>The advanced  tab in the Intel<sup>&#174</sup> PROSet
software includes a setting called Enable PME for
some adapters. To explicitly allow wake up
with a Magic Packet from shutdown under APM power management mode, set this to
Enable. See Intel PROSet online help for more details.</p>
<p>In
ACPI-capable versions of Windows, the Intel PROSet advanced settings also include
a setting called Wake on Settings. This controls the type of packets that
wake up the system from standby. See Intel PROSet online help for a complete
explanation.</p>
<p>In
ACPI computers running ACPI-aware operating systems such as Windows 2000, make
sure the wake on standby option is enabled. To enable wake on standby, open the
Device Manager and then navigate to the adapter properties tab Power Management.
Check the setting “Allow this device to bring the computer out of standby”.</p>
