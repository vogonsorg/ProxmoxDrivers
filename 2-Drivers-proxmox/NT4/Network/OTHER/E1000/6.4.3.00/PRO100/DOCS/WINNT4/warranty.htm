<P CLASS="Legal-Type">
Intel warrants to the original owner that the adapter product delivered in this package will be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty does not cover the adapter product if it is damaged in the process of being installed or improperly used. </P>
<P CLASS="Legal-Type">
THE ABOVE WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARISING OUT OF ANY PROPOSAL, SPECIFICATION, OR SAMPLE. </P>
<P CLASS="Legal-Type">
This warranty does not cover replacement of adapter products damaged by abuse, accident, misuse, neglect, alteration, repair, disaster, improper installation, or improper testing. If the adapter product is found to be defective, Intel, at its option, will replace or repair the hardware product at no charge except as set forth below, or refund your purchase price provided that you deliver the adapter product along with a Return Material Authorization
(RMA) number (see below), along with proof of purchase (if not registered), either to the dealer from whom you purchased it or to Intel with an explanation of any deficiency. If you ship the adapter product, you must assume the risk of damage or loss in transit. You must use the original container (or the equivalent) and pay the shipping charge.</P>
<P CLASS="Legal-Type">
Intel may replace or repair the adapter product with either new or reconditioned parts, and any adapter product, or part thereof replaced by Intel becomes Intel's property.  Repaired or replaced adapter products will be returned to you at the same revision level as received or higher, at Intel's option.  Intel reserves the right to replace discontinued adapter products with an equivalent current generation adapter product.</P>
