<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>This file describes the Intel&reg; <i> Advanced Network Services</i> (ANS) package,
version 3.4.x, for Linux* systems. Intel ANS provides both <a href="#teaming">teaming</a>
(including <a href="#mvt">Multi-Vendor Teaming</a>), and IEEE <a href="#vlans">VLAN</a>
capabilities.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
For ANS support, this package version must be used with the Linux base driver
version e100-3.0.x for PRO/100 adapters and/or driver version 
e1000-5.3.x or later for PRO/1000 adapters. Base drivers provided in some distributions
do not contain the MII interface that is necessary for ANS.
</p>
This package is intended for 2.4.7 and higher kernels; it was tested primarily 
on the Red Hat* Enterprise Linux ES 2.1 kernel 2.4.9-e.27 and&nbsp; Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux ES 3 kernel 2.4.21-4.EL on SMP Intel processor-based systems. 
This package includes support for Itanium™-based systems.

<p>
This version of ANS may be configured with the PROCfg command-line utility. This 
reporting and configuration tool reduces the command-line input required with the 
manual configuration method described in this document. At this time, PROCfg is 
only available for 32-bit architectures (<a href="http://support.intel.com" target="_blank">http://support.intel.com</a>).

<h3><a name="teaming"></a>Teaming</h3>

<p>This package supports the following teaming modes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Adapter Fault Tolerance (AFT)</b>. Default mode when a team is created and 
the mode is not specified. A secondary adapter in the team automatically takes 
over on any failure of the primary connection (cable, adapter or port). Only one 
network adapter is active at a time. After a failover, if the connection to the 
former primary adapter is restored, and it was set to be the preferred primary, 
control passes automatically back to that primary adapter, otherwise no failback 
is performed. May mix speed and duplex capabilities and settings. May use a hub 
or switch.</p>
<p>
<b>Switch Fault Tolerance (SFT)</b>. Provides a fail-over between
switches when each adapter in the team is connected to a separate switch. 
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) must be turned on
in the switches and the forward delay parameter of ANS must be defined 
according to the switch settings. We recommend that you set the ANS forward delay 
parameter to twice the value of the STP forward delay configured on the switch. SFT teaming mode has been tested with the following
configuration only: exactly two members in a team connected to two switches, with one
member set as preferred primary and the other as preferred secondary; the
switches’ setup was similar to that in the following diagram:
</p>
<img border="0" src="sft.jpg" width="375" height="243">
<p>
<b>Adaptive Load Balancing (ALB)</b>. Includes Receive Load Balancing (RLB). A team of 2-8 
adapters that performs receive and transmit load balancing with no required switch configuration. 
Supports mixed-speed/duplex settings among team members. Includes fault tolerance. An ALB team may be created with or without RLB enabled.
</p>
<p>If RLB is enabled (default), all active adapters with the highest speeds load 
balance the IPv4 received traffic, and the primary adapter receives traffic 
using any protocol. Receive Load balancing is achieved by using the Address 
Resolution Protocol (ARP). Therefore, all packets coming from clients behind a 
router will be assigned the same receiving member that the router was assigned. 
For ALB teams with RLB disabled, only the primary adapter receives.</p>
<p>
<b>Static Link Aggregation</b>. A team of 2-8 adapters that provides increased 
transmission and reception throughput. This mode also includes adapter fault 
tolerance and load balancing (only routed protocols). This teaming mode requires 
a switch with Intel<sup>®</sup> Link Aggregation or Cisco* FEC or GEC 
capability. This team replaces the following team modes from prior software 
releases: Fast EtherChannel*/Link Aggregation (FEC) and Gigabit EtherChannel*/Link 
Aggregation (GEC). All adapters in a Link Aggregation team running in static 
mode must run at the same speed and must be connected to a Static Link 
Aggregation capable switch. If the speed capability of adapters in a Static Link 
Aggregation team are different, the speed of the team is dependent on the 
switch.&nbsp;Spanning Tree Protocol must be turned off.</p>

<p>
<b>IEEE 802.3ad: dynamic (802.3ad)</b>. This mode is the IEEE standard for the
technology incorporated into Cisco's FEC* method. ANS support for dynamic 802.3ad
teaming is similar to that for Static Link Aggregation teaming. In addition to the benefits 
of Link Aggregation, IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic Link Aggregation generally offers the 
following advantages: Automatic Configuration, Rapid Configuration and 
Reconfiguration, and Deterministic Behavior. It consists of a team of 2-8 
adapters that simultaneously receive and transmit data. Aggregation groups 
include only members with full duplex and the same speed. Includes fault 
tolerance and load balancing. Requires a switch that supports the IEEE 802.3ad 
dynamic standard. Must match switch aggregation requirements.
</p>

<p><b>NONE</b>. A team of one Intel adapter that adds VLAN
support on top of one existing interface. Does not require an
Intel server adapter. VLAN-enabled must be set.

    <td><i><b>NOTES</b>:</i> You must have at least one Intel PRO/100 or 
    PRO/1000 server adapter to form a team.<p>For AFT, SFT, and ALB, you may 
    specify which adapters in a team you want to use as the primary and 
    secondary adapters. The primary one is the main adapter used in a team. For 
    AFT/SFT, the primary one is the only adapter used until a failure occurs. 
    For ALB, the primary one is the adapter that both transmits and receives. 
    For ALB+RLB, the primary adapter is the only adapter that receives non-IPv4 
    traffic. In a team of more than two adapters, the secondary adapter fills 
    the primary's role if the primary adapter fails. Also, fail back will not 
    occur unless the primary has been specified. If the priority is not 
    specified before the team is activated, the adapter with the highest 
    supported speed is chosen. If all adapters support the same speed, the last 
    one added is the primary adapter.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h3>Probes</h3>
<p>ANS supplies a periodic probes mechanism for checking the health of the 
system and discovering connectivity problems. The probes mechanism can help 
detect situations of wrong switch configuration: e.g., a port is disabled or has 
a wrong VLAN setting that otherwise would not be detected by ANS. Without probes 
enabled, ANS can only detect link loss and hardware/software failures reported 
by the base driver. You can use the probes mechanism for confirming your 
system's connectivity after configuration changes. Probes can be used in all 
non-Link Aggregation teaming modes, including AFT, SFT, and ALB(+RLB). Fine 
tuning of the probe parameters can scale failover time and enhance the system's 
reliability. Probes are on by default in teams with three or more adapters, and 
off by default otherwise. The team must include at least two adapters for the 
probes mechanism to work. If you create a team of two members and later add a 
third member, probes will not be enabled by default. See the PROCfg or ianscfg 
man page for information on how to change probes parameters. </p>

    <td><i><b>NOTES</b>:</i>&nbsp; The probes mechanism can only indicate that 
    there is connectivity between the members of the team. They do not indicate 
    that there is connectivity to other clients on the network. When probes are 
    enabled and the forward delay parameter of ANS is set the status of the 
    probes will override the forward delay, and a member will be activated as 
    soon as it transmits and receives probes successfully even if the forward 
    delay is not up yet. In systems where connectivity between members does not 
    indicate that the switch is ready to forward traffic to other clients (if 
    forward delay could vary for different ports on the switch), probes must be 
    turned off for the forward delay to be effective. </td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="mvt"></a>Multi-Vendor Teaming</h3>
<p>
<i>Multi-Vendor Teaming</i>  (MVT) adds the capability to include non-Intel adapters from&nbsp;selected vendors in a team (AFT, SFT, ALB(+RLB), 
Static Link Aggregation, 802.3ad). MVT cannot be used with VLANs.
</p>

<p>
In order to activate MVT, you must have at least one Intel server adapter&nbsp;in the team that is designated as the primary adapter. Adapters from&nbsp;other vendors must be properly loaded. Use the same command line parameters
for building the team as with all Intel adapters. All members in an MVT
operate on a common feature set.
</p>

<p>
Base driver is required to support Ethtool version 1.2.<br>
<br>
For high availability (link loss detection and current speed/duplex), the base 
driver is also required to include support for one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ethtool version 1.4</li>
  <li>MII (for 10/100 adapters only)</li>
  <li>Update of the netif_carrier flag when link status changes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p>
ANS defaults to the netif_carrier option if ethtool and MII support was not 
found.</p>

    <td><i><b>NOTES</b>:</i>  For RLB teams, some adapters produced by non-Intel vendors do not 
    support setting the MAC address of the device while it is open. Therefore, swapping MAC 
    addresses during failover is impossible. This creates a problem when RLB is enabled, as 
    each team member must use a unique MAC address. As a workaround, ANS sets the non-Intel 
    adapter to work in promiscuous mode when it becomes the primary after a failover occurs. 
    The adapter will stay promiscuous as long as the MAC address that it is using differs 
    from that of the adapter's hardware.</td>

<h3><a name="vlans"></a>VLANs</h3>
<p>
IEEE 802.3ac Virtual LANs (VLANs) are based on the addition of a tag to the packet header. All
equipment on the network that passes this traffic must be capable of handling
the extra length. Settings on the adapter must match the VLAN settings on the
switch. 
There is a limit of 64 VLANs per server; however, VLAN IDs may be numbered from 1
to 4094.

         For older kernels, ANS implements software VLAN tagging and stripping. For VLAN hardware 
         off-loading (enhanced performance) on older kernels you must use ANS driver version 
    1.2.x to 2.0.x, plus the appropriate base driver version(s) for that ANS driver.</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Setting VLANs statically:</b>
<br>
When working with VLAN tagging, all the ports on the switch connected to the server 
should be configured to be tagged. In some Cisco
switches it is possible to configure ports to be both tagged and untagged at the
same time; although, this configuration will result in communication loss.
</p>
<p>
When adding new VLAN IDs to an active team the switch ports attached to the team's 
members must be configured with the new VLAN IDs prior to adding them to the ANS team. 
Otherwise, ANS might disable members that are not sensing probes on the new VLAN IDs 
because the switch is not configured accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Setting VLANs dynamically - GVRP:</b>
<br>
VLANs may be set dynamically with the GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP).
GVRP is an industry-standard protocol designed to dynamically create and manage
VLAN information from device to device. With GVRP, a single switch is manually
configured with all the desired VLANs for the network, and all other switches on
the network obtain the VLAN information dynamically.
</p>
<p>
If GVRP is enabled in the team and in the switch, the switch ports connected
to the server should not be marked as tagged, but will be dynamically 
configured by ANS whenever VLAN IDs are added and removed from the team.

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installing ANS</h2>
<p>
Installation assumes all necessary build tools, kernel sources, and headers 
are in place and properly configured.
</p>

<p>
To compile and install the base driver package(s), see the readme included with those drivers.
Ensure no other base drivers are loaded or
		compiled into the kernel for any of the Intel adapters (e.g., eepro, eepro100,
eexpress, e100, e1000). Ensure the configuration
		files have been edited to alias the new driver(s). See the <a href="#ex_file"> Example Setup</a> section for an example
		file.

<h3>Modifying ANS</h3>
<p>
ANS configuration and topology may be changed, with a few limitations.
After a team is activated, you may change member priorities, add or remove team members,
add or remove virtual adapters, or remove a team entirely. You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="numlst">Change the team mode.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Enable or disable RLB teaming mode.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Remove or add VLAN support.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Enable or disable GVRP.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Remove a team's last virtual adapter.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Remove the last member of a team with open virtual adapters.</li>
  <li><p class="numlst">Remove the last server adapter of a team with open virtual adapters.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a team is left with no server adapter or with no members at all, it goes
into an idle state until members are added. During such an idle period, resources used by the team are not freed.
</p>

<p>
For instructions on modifying ANS, see the instructions in either the <a href="#config_scripted">scripted</a>
or <a href="#config_manual">manual</a> configuration methods.
</p>

<h3>
Hot Add/Remove of Members</h3>

<p>
A member can be added or removed from a team when it is up and active with 
certain limitations:</p>

<p>
<b>Hot Add:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>The member must support the team's capabilities such as mtu size, vlan, 
  speed etc.</li>
  <li>The number of members in a team is limited to 8 members.</li>
  <li>For Static Link Aggregation teams, the member should be added to the team with link down. The 
  reason is that when a port is added to a switch channel before the adapter is 
  added to the ANS team, disconnections will occur because the switch will start 
  forwarding traffic to the port before the member is actually configured. The 
  opposite, where the member is first added to the ANS team and then added to 
  the switch channel, is also problematic because ANS will forward traffic to 
  the member before the port is added to the switch channel. </li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Hot Remove:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>You cannot remove the last member of a team with open virtual adapters.</li>
  <li>You cannot remove the last server adapter of a team with open virtual 
  adapters.</li>
  <li>For Static Link Aggregation teams, the member should be removed from the team with link down for 
  the same reason as described for hot add.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="config_scripted"></a>Scripted Configuration</h3>
<p>
For ease of configuration, Intel supplies an interactive script to help 
configure an ANS topology. The script offers only the basic and most common 
configuration capabilities. To be able to use all available configuration options, 
refer to the Manual Configuration section, and to the ianscfg man page.
</p>
<p>
Before using the interactive script to create and modify an ANS topology, ensure 
the necessary base drivers (e.g. e100, e1000) are loaded.
</p>
<p>
To use the script, enter:
</p>
<blockquote class="monospace">
	ianstool
</blockquote>	
<p>
You will be prompted with an interactive menu, offering several possible actions 
to be performed on the topology. These actions include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">
Adding a team</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">
Deleting an existing team</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">
Viewing an existing team’s status</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">
Configuring an existing team’s topology (i.e. adding/removing members and virtual adapters)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">
Saving the current topology</li>
</ol>
<p>
The script will prompt you for necessary information, such as the teaming mode, as you go along. As noted above, the script does not offer all&nbsp;possible configuration options that are available in ANS. For information on configuring options that are not available with the script, refer to the
Manual Configuration section.

<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Network Parameters Boot Configuration</h2>
<p>
If you want your virtual adapters' network parameters (i.e. IP address, netmask, etc.) to load 
after the next reboot, you must first ensure you have saved your topology to load on the next 
reboot. For details, see the Scripted Configuration and Manual Configuration sections.
</p>
<p>
You can save your virtual adapters' network parameters for boot in one of two ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst"> Using the network and system configuration tools that are provided by your distribution 
  (e.g. netconf, setup, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Manually edit or create the virtual adapters' boot configuration files
    (usually named 
  		ifcfg-&lt;vadapter name>). This can be slightly different for different distributions. 
  		Following are specific examples for common distributions. If you have a different Linux 
  		distribution, the configuration files' location and syntax should still be similar (if 
  		nor identical) to one of the examples shown below. You should find the directory that 
  		includes the adapters' configuration files in your distribution, and follow the syntax 
  		of the other configuration files there.</p>
	<p class="numlst"><b>Red Hat</b>:</p>

<h2><a name="Known"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<h3>Multiple Interfaces on Same Ethernet Broadcast Network</h3>
<p>Due to the default ARP behavior on Linux, it is not possible to have one 
system on two IP networks in the same Ethernet broadcast domain <br>
(non-partitioned switch) behave as expected. All Ethernet interfaces will 
respond to IP traffic for any IP address assigned to the system.<br>
This results in unbalanced receive traffic.<br>
<br>
If you have multiple interfaces in a server, either turn on ARP filtering by 
entering:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter<br>
(this only works if your kernel's version is higher than 2.4.5), <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or,<br>
<br>
install the interfaces in separate broadcast domains (either in different 
switches or in a switch partitioned to VLANs).</p>
<h3>DHCP is not supported on 802.3ad teams</h3>
<p>802.3ad and DHCP are not compatible in this release. Use DHCP with a non-AD 
configuration.</p>

<h3>DHCP Sometimes Fails to Configure a Virtual Adapter's IP Address</h3>

<p>&quot;Service network restart&quot; will fail to configure a virtual adapter IP with DHCP if the virtual adapter interface name is lexicographically smaller than the 
interface names of team members (physical adapters). The system's network 
service runs the network scripts according to their lexicographical order, so 
the lexicographical order of the interface names determines whether the virtual 
adapters or members are brought up first. For successful DHCP configuration of a 
virtual adapter IP, the members interfaces must be up and running before the 
DHCP negotiation for the virtual adapter's IP starts.</p>
