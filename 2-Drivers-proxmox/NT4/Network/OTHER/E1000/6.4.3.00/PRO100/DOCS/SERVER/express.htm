<h1>Express Teaming</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">Express Teaming is an easy-to-use, high-performance teaming 
solution for a multi-port Adapter on Windows* 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003*.<font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An Express Team teams ALL ports of a multi-port adapter. 
One port is called the initiator or primary port. All other ports are called 
secondary ports. After an Express Team is created, you can change the settings 
for the team via the primary port. All secondary ports are hidden. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you create an Express Team, all ports for the adapter 
are automatically added to the Express Team.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Express Teaming</h2>

<p>In Windows, install the driver and use Intel&#174; PROSet to set up Express&nbsp; 
teams. For information about installing drivers and Intel PROSet, select the 
appropriate topic in the Table of Contents (left pane of this window).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The only requirements for Express Teaming are the driver 
and a multi-port Intel® PRO/1000 adapter.</p>

<h2>Express Teaming Modes</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Express Teaming is based on Load Balancing 
technology supplied by Microsoft. An Express Team supports Receive Load Balancing (RLB).</p>

<h2>Link Status</h2>

<p>Each port in an Express Team displays an event log message about it's link 
state. The link of the team is displayed in the system tray or in the Network 
Control Panel Applet (NCPA). If none of the ports have link, link status for the team 
is displayed as no link. </p>
<h2>Adapters Supported</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Express Teaming is available for multi-port Intel&#174; PRO/1000  adapters only.<br>
