    <p class="numlst">Make sure you’re using the drivers that are on the
    drivers CD that ships with this adapter.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Make sure the driver is loaded and the protocols are
    bound. Check the Device Properties list for trouble indicators (an X or !
    symbol).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Test the adapter with the Intel&reg; PROSet advanced configuration
    utility that was installed on your system when you installed the PRO/100 S
    Server adapter. To start Intel PROSet, double-click the Intel PROSet icon in Control
    Panel. To run diagnostics, select the adapter and click the Diagnostics tab,
    then click Run Tests. For additional information, click Help in the Intel PROSet
    window.</li>

Windows 98 is unable to update device driver files
</TD>
<TD COLSPAN="1" class="numlst" valign="top" align="left">
    If you're using Windows 98 and have updated or added an adapter, you may experience a problem with device driver update files not being
    copied.  (This is a known problem, for which Microsoft has published a Knowledge Base article, Q242150.)
    To resolve this problem:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p class="numlst">Reboot the computer.</li>
      <li>
        <p class="numlst">Remove the adapter via Device Manager and reboot the computer again.</li>
      <li>
        <p class="numlst">When prompted for the adapter driver, choose the option "Display a<br>
   list of all the drivers...".  Then choose the adapter from the list<br>
   and click Have Disk to update the drivers from the Product CD.</li>
      <li>
        <p class="numlst">Reboot the computer.</li>

Install prompting for Prodd.vxd and Prokddp.vxd files in Windows&nbsp;98<br>
</TD>
<TD COLSPAN="1" class="numlst" valign="top" align="left">
    If you use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Windows Control Panel to remove an Intel adapter, and then try to install drivers from a later
    Product CD, you may see a prompt asking for the following files:<br>
    &quot;Prodd.vxd&quot;<br>
    &quot;Prokddp.vxd&quot;
    <p>This is because Windows is attempting to install the files associated with the earlier driver, which are not present on the later 
    Product CD.
    <p>To resolve this problem, finish the installation and choose "Skip" when prompted for a missing file.  Then, instead of removing the driver,
    update it with the later Product CD.
    <p>For instructions on updating the adapter driver, see the "Install the Network Drivers" section in
    this online guide.&nbsp;
