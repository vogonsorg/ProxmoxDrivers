<h1>Intel Client Instrumentation 3.0	for Desktop Management Interface (DMI) 2.0</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Directory Contents and Overview</h2>
<p>
The \APPS\DMI\WINNT4 directory contains Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI Ver 3.0
for
Microsoft* Windows NT* 4.0 with Service Pack 3 including NDIS HotFix&nbsp;or with a subsequent Service Pack.
<p>
This directory contains the MIF files your management software will need to view in order to view the
Intel<sup>&#174</sup> adapter functions.
<p>
The DMI 2.0 SP SDK v1.10 (Service Provider) setup program is located&nbsp;under APPS\DMI\SERVPROV on the 
Product CD. This must be installed or
Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI Version 3.0 will not work.
<p>
The DMI 2.0 Service Provider (SP) and Client Instrumentation&nbsp;3.0 for Windows (CI) are updated software modules that&nbsp;allow standards-based DMI 2.0 applications,&nbsp;including
LANDesk<sup>*</sup> Client Manager, to monitor the status
of PCI adapters. The drivers included in this directory can be used to view both single adapter information and custom information
including AFT/ALB teaming, VLAN, and Flow Control.&nbsp;
<h2>
Software Requirements and Install File Locations</h2>
<p>
The software requirements to run the Intel Client Instrumentation are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">A Windows NT 4.0-based operating system.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Any Intel NDIS PCI adapter driver. Intel Client Instrumentation&nbsp;supports all Intel PCI PRO/100, PRO/100+ and PRO/1000 adapters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are running an NDIS-based driver under Windows NT 4.0, there&nbsp;is no need to install any new drivers to get DMI support.&nbsp;
<p>
The Service Provider must be installed in order to use the Intel DMI Instrumentation. However, the instrumentation may be installed either
before or after installing the Service Provider.  If you have a Service Provider later than Version 2.0 already installed, you do not
need to install the Service Provider from the Product CD.
<p>
To install the Intel Client Instrumentation (this is not order dependent):
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Run \APPS\DMI\SERVPROV\SETUP.EXE (to install the Service Provider)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Restart the system. This is required for the Service Provider to start.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Run \APPS\DMI\WINNT4\INSTALL.EXE (to install the Client Instrumentation)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Uninstall Procedure</h2>
<p>
To properly uninstall the Client Instrumentation, the Service&nbsp;Provider software must still be running. Then go to
Add/Remove Software in the Windows Control Panel and select "Intel Client Instrumentation for DMI" and click the
Remove button.<p>
After Intel Client Instrumentation is removed from this list, you&nbsp;may remove the Service Provider software through the
<b> Start &gt; Programs</b>&nbsp;menu. MIFs usually do not require removal, but if you should
wish to remove the Intel specific files, see the documentation for your Management application.
<h2>
Supported Standards</h2>
<p>
The DMI instrumentation on this CD does not comply with the DMTF DMI 2.0&nbsp;standards.  For directions on how to install a DMI version which complies&nbsp;to the standards, go to the 
<a href="support.htm">support website</a>.
<p>
At this time there are no user sets. There are sets in the&nbsp;IBM Failover Adapter Table Group that are required by the IBM&nbsp;Hot 
Plug process but there is no user set allowed.&nbsp;
<p>
Only the following events listed in the ni_nic.mif are currently supported:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Cable unplugged/No LAN activity</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Adapter initialization failure</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">AFT/ALB events (Adapter Fault Tolerance/Adaptive Load Balancing)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Known Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Known Problems in Installation and Un-installation Order:</p>
    <p class="numlst">
a. Version 3.0 of the Intel Client Instrumentation may not install correctly over an existing Version 1.0 of the Intel DMI&nbsp;Network Adapter Instrumentation Layer. The Uninstall feature may
    not work correctly after upgrading so please uninstall Ver 1.0 BEFORE upgrading. In order to install Version 3.0 correctly,&nbsp;please use the documented Uninstall procedures for Version 1.0.
    <p class="numlst">
b. If the TCP/IP protocol is removed after installing the Client&nbsp;Instrumentation, you must reinstall the Client Instrumentation&nbsp;again after you reinstall TCP/IP.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Enumeration of adapters, teams and VLANs takes place when the
    DMI instrumentation starts.  Hence, if teams or VLANs are added while the DMI instrumentation is running, the new teams or VLANs
    will not show up until the DMI instrumentation has been restarted.</li>
