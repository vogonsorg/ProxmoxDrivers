ability to remotely wake computers is an important development in computer
management. This feature has evolved over the last few years from a simple
remote power-on capability to a complex system interacting with a variety of
device and operating system (OS) power states.</span>

<h3><b>Wake on Magic Packet</b></h3>
<p>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In early implementations of Remote
Wake-up, the computer could be started from a power-off state by sending a Magic
Packet. A Magic Packet is an Ethernet packet that contains an adapter’s MAC
address repeated 16 times in the data field. When an adapter receives a Magic
Packet containing its own MAC address, it activates the computer’s power. This
enables network administrators to perform off-hours maintenance at remote
locations without sending a technician out.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This early implementation did not
require an OS that was aware of remote wake-up. However, it did require a
computer that was equipped with a standby power supply and had the necessary
circuitry to allow the remote power control. These computers were typically
equipped with a feature named Advanced Power Management (APM). APM provided
BIOS-based power control.<o:p>

computers feature ACPI, which
extends the APM concept to enable the OS to selectively control power. ACPI
supports a variety of power states. Each state represents a different level of
power, from fully powered up to completely powered down, with partial levels of
power in each intermediate state. Power states include:</span>

<p>Some newer machines do not support being woke up from a powered-off state.<p>Remote wake-up can
be initiated by a variety of user selectable packet types and is not limited to
the Magic Packet format. For more information about supported packet types, see
the operating system settings section.

<h3>Wake Up Address Patterns</h3>

<p>The wake up capability of Intel gigabit adapters is based on patterns that
are sent by the OS. You may configure the driver to the following settings using
the Intel PROSet utility:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst"><b>OS Controlled</b> - accept all the patterns sent by the OS.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst"><b>Directed Packets</b> - accepts only patterns containing the Adapter's Ethernet
    address in the Ethernet Header or containing the IP address, assigned to the
    adapter, in the IP header.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst"><b>Magic Packets</b> - accept only patterns containing 16 consecutive repetitions
    of the adapter's MAC address.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst"><b>Directed &amp; Magic</b> - accepts the patterns of both directed packets and
    magic packets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing &quot;Directed Packets&quot; will also accept patterns of the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) querying the IP address assigned to the
adapter. Upon configuring multiple IP addresses to one adapter, the OS may
request to wake up on ARP patterns to all of the configured addresses. The
adapter will only awaken in response to ARP packets querying the first IP
address in the list.</p>

<h3><b>Wake on LAN* (WOL) Cable</b></h3>
<h4>For computers with a PCI 2.1 compliant bus</h4>
<p>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A Wake on LAN (WOL) cable is required
on all remote wake-up capable adapters when used in older WOL-capable
computers. These computers are generally equipped with a PCI 2.1 complaint bus
and the BIOS is typically designed for APM compliant power management.</span>

<h4>For computers with a PCI 2.2 compliant bus&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Wake on LAN cable is not usually required for computers equipped with a
PCI 2.2 compliant bus, as the wake up signal is routed through the PCI bus. This
is done through the PCI connector pin defined as PME (Power Management Event).
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Many
of the newer ACPI computers also have a connector for the 3-pin Wake on LAN
cable for backwards compatibility with older WOL capable adapters. In this type
of computer, the WOL cable is still required for older 82558-based Intel&reg;
PRO/100+ Management adapter model numbers PILA8900 and PILA8461.</span>
<h4><b>Slot
</b></h4>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Some
motherboards only support remote wake-up (or remote wake-up from S5 state)
in a particular slot. For example, the Intel&reg; Desktop Board D815EPEA2 only
supports remote wake-up from a powered off (S5) state if the adapter is plugged
into PCI slot 2. It does, however, support remote wake-up from standby from any
slot. See the documentation that came with your system or motherboard for
details on remote wake-up support.</span>
<h4>
<b>Power
</b></h4>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Early versions of the Intel
PRO/100+ Management adapter are +5 volt only. These models must have the 3-pin
cable attached for the remote wake-up function to work. These adapters are equipped with 3 LEDs on the adapter
bracket, whereas the PCI 2.2 compliant PRO/100 models have 2 LEDs on the adapter
bracket. The older +5 volt model adapters are not compliant to the PCI 2.2
specification and do not fit in a 3-volt only PCI slot due to the slot being
keyed differently.</span>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Newer Intel PRO adapters are 3.3
volt, but work in a 5-volt slot also. They are keyed to fit either type of
slot.</span>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If your computer requires the 3-pin
cable, the +5 volt standby power&nbsp;supply must supply
at least 0.2 amps at +5 volts for each Intel PRO adapter installed. For older
PCI 2.1 compliant management adapters, the power supply must supply at least .6 amps. This value is usually
listed on the power supply label as +5SB, +5VSB or +5AUX.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">If
your remote wake-up enabled computer is compliant to PCI specification 2.2, it does not require the 3-pin cable for remote wake-up. In these&nbsp;computers,
the 3.3 volt standby power supply <i> must</i> provide at least 0.2 amps for
each Intel PRO adapter installed. You may need to contact your computer
manufacturer to verify the standby current rating. Turning off the remote wake
up capability on the adapter by using the IBAUTIL utility reduces the power draw to
around 50 milliamps (.05 amps) per adapter.</span>

<h2><b><a name="BIOS">BIOS Settings</a></b></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">You may need to
configure various
settings in the computer BIOS so that remote
wake-up will work.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Many ACPI
computers can be configured to work in APM mode. Check your BIOS settings to
determine which mode you are operating in.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In both APM and
ACPI computers, you may find settings for Wake on LAN* under the Power Control
area and titled “Wake on LAN” and/or “Wake on PME”. Wake on LAN setting
refers to wake up events received through the 3-pin header cable. Wake on PME
refers to wake up events received through the PCI bus. To enable remote wake-up,
you should enable the setting that corresponds to your adapter connection. For
example, set Wake on LAN to enable if you are using the WOL cable.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">In
ACPI computers operating in ACPI mode and using an ACPI aware OS such
as Windows 2000, look for an ACPI specific setting. If you want to power up the system from a power off
state, set an ACPI specific setting such as “Wake on LAN from S5” to enable.</span>
