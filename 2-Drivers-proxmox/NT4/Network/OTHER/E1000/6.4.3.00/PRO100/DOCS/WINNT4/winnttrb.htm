<P>If Windows NT reports an error or you can’t connect to the network, try the
suggestions here first, then refer to the general troubleshooting steps.</P>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Make sure that you use the drivers for this adapter.
    Drivers are located on the Product CD.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">In your computer’s BIOS settings, make sure &quot;Plug
    and Play OS&quot; is set to NO.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Make sure the driver is loaded and the protocols are
    bound. Check the Settings in the Control Panel’s Network/Bindings dialog
    box.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Check the Windows NT Event Viewer for error messages.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">If you are attaching to a NetWare network, check your
    frame type and verify that NetWare client or server software has been
    installed.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Test the adapter using the diagnostics tab of the Intel PROSet
    control panel utility (this was installed on your system when you installed the
    adapter).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p class="numlst">Check with your LAN administrator — you may need to
    install supplemental networking software.</li>
</ul>
