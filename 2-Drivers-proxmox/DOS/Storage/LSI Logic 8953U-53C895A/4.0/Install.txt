This file provides instructions for running the DOS Installation Utility,
which allows you to install the DOS drivers quickly and easily.

The installation program (install.exe) provides a graphical user inter-
face similar to Windows environments. You may use the mouse or traverse
the buttons and windows in the standard DOS way using tabs and arrows.

Here are some helpful aids if using the standard DOS method:

o  Press F1 (Help function key) to obtain context sensitive help for
   any given window.    

o  Use the tab keys to move around from button to button or group to group.

o  Use the up, down, left, or right arrows keys to position the cursor and
   select an item.

o  Use the Esc (Escape key) to close a window or return to a previous 
   window.

To install the DOS Drivers using this utility, follow these steps:

1.  Copy these files to a blank, formatted floppy diskette:

       install.exe
       z_8xx.dat
       aspi8xx.sys
       symcd.sys
       symdisk.sys

2. Boot your system, insert the newly created diskette, and type
   at the DOS prompt (A: or B:):

   INSTALL   

3. Press Enter.

   A window displays offering two installation choices.

4. Choose one of these two options:

   Express installation (default) 

   This installation choice requires minimal user interaction and installs
   all the DOS drivers into a directory called C:\symbios. If this option
   is selected, the drivers are copied and the CONFIG.SYS and SYSTEM.INI
   files are modified.

   -or-

   Custom Installation 
  
   The second choice is a selectable installation that allows you to choose 
   individual drivers to install and choose the destination directory for
   the drivers. If you choose this option, the next window gives you a
   list of the available drivers to install:

   ASPI8XX.SYS, SYMCD.SYS and SYMDISK.SYS.

   Additionally, this window allows you to change the default drive and
   directory where the DOS drivers will be copied.

5. Choose OK to allow the installation to take place.

   A final Installation complete window appears with various messages depending
   on your driver selection. 

   For example, if the CD-ROM (SYMCD.SYS) driver is selected, it warns you of
   the need to make sure the MSCDEX.EXE driver is loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file in the following form:

       [path]\MSCDEX.EXE /D:SYM001 

   WHERE:

     - the /D switch matches the /D switch of the SYMCD driver line in the
     CONFIG.SYS file. If they do not match, the CD-ROM drive will not be
     recognized. MSCDEX is a Microsoft product which LSI Logic is not 
     authorized to distribute.
