******************************* Introduction **********************************

In SDMS 4.0, the SCSI BIOS for the LSI Logic family of PCI SCSI chips is capable
of mapping SCSI hard disk drives behind any non-SCSI hard disk drives 
(IDE, ESDI, etc.) within the same system. A driver-less solution will allow
connection of up to 24 hard drives (SCSI and non-SCSI) under DOS 5.0 and above. 

Full Virtual DMA Services (VDS), including features such as scatter-gather, 
are also supported by the SCSI BIOS. Therefore, to gain maximum 
performance, you should disable any double buffer option provided by disk 
caching software (such as Microsoft's SMARTDRV.EXE) for all drives 
handled through SDMS.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  * When You Need to Load Drivers *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Connecting peripherals other than hard disk drives requires loading the
appropriate driver. Some of the drivers work together, and some are capable of
direct communication with a LSI Logic PCI/SCSI controller.


*  *  * ASPI8XX.SYS *  *  *

This driver is an ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programming Interface) manager which 
provides standard ASPI compatibility between your SCSI host adapter hardware
and ASPI compatible applications.


*   *   * SYMDISK.SYS *   *   *

This is a device driver for non-INT13h SCSI disk drives and removable media
devices, and it works through the ASPI manager.


*   *   * SYMCD.SYS *   *   *

This is a device driver for CD-ROM drives, and it works through the ASPI 
manager.


The following sections list these drivers, their features, and their 
loading requirements.


********************* Installation of SDMS Drivers for DOS ******************

This section provides information for quick installation of the DOS device
drivers.

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Using the DOS Installation Utility *  *  *  *  *  *

The LSI Logic SDMS DOS Installation Utility provides a quick and easy method  
for performing either an automatic or custom installation of the SCSI device 
drivers in a DOS/Windows environment. It works with any system using an SDMS
supported LSI Logic SCSI chip. The DOS Installation Utility identifies the system, 
scans the SCSI bus, and properly installs the needed SCSI device drivers.

The SDMS Software Device Drivers diskette that contains the DOS device drivers 
also holds the DOS Installation Utility. To use the utility, insert the disk 
into your floppy drive while in the DOS environment, and type:

     INSTALL

Press Enter, and then follow the directions presented on the screen.

When performing a custom installation, an understanding of the information
presented in the following sections for manual installation may prove useful.

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  

Here is a potential problem and a suggested solution:

If a menuing system exists in CONFIG.SYS and multiple menu selections are available 
that already include some of our drivers, LSI Logic only updates the first menu selection 
found that already contains our drivers rather than all of them. However, if SDMS 
drivers are not present, it will put the new drivers in the common area and create a 
common menu item one if it does not exist.

A workaround regarding menuing in the CONFIG.SYS is to ensure the install program puts
the drivers where you want them. By default they are put in the common area. However, 
if some of the SDMS drivers are already present, the install program may incorrectly 
guess where the new ones should be put.


************************* About Your ASPI8XX.SYS Driver ***********************

This section provides information concerning the pertinent features and 
general description of the ASPI8XX.SYS device manager.

This ASPI8XX.SYS driver is an ASPI manager that provides an interface to
popular ASPI applications. It is required when you want to use SYMDISK.SYS or
SYMCD.SYS, or whenever you want to run an ASPI application.

This interface replaces an SDMS BIOS (if present), and fully supports all devices
supported by the BIOS. If an SDMS BIOS is not present, only an ASPI interface
is provided.


*********************** Installing Your ASPI8XX.SYS Driver ********************

To install the ASPI8XX.SYS driver, follow these steps:

1. Use the COPY command to copy the ASPI8XX.SYS driver from the SDMS SCSI
   Drivers diskette to your boot disk.

2. Add this line to the system's CONFIG.SYS file:

   DEVICE=C:[path]ASPI8XX.SYS

This line must appear before any line loading other SDMS drivers (such as,
SYMCD.SYS, SYMDISK.SYS), or any other ASPI compliant driver/application.

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Command Line Options *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The ASPI8XX.SYS driver has several configurable features that are set by using
switches on the command line in your CONFIG.SYS file.

The command line options are as follows and the usage is detailed below:

    /NORST, /ASK, /WIDTH (or /W), /DISCONNECT (or /DC), /SYNCH_RATE (or /SR),
    /SYNCH_OFFSET (or /SO), /PARITY (or /P), /EXCLUDE (or /X), /HOST_ID (or /ID),
    /TIMEOUT (or /T), /VERBOSE (or /V)

In the following descriptions, "path" refers to the adapter number (boot order
designation), and "id" refers to the SCSI ID. The following conventions are also
used:

     [ ]   items in brackets are optional
    
      *    means repeat item 0 or more times

IMPORTANT: No spaces are allowed within a single command line option, but
           spaces are required between different command line options. Using
           these command line options will override the settings in the SCSI
           BIOS Configuration Utility.


*   *   * Using the /NORST Option *   *   *        

This option prevents a SCSI bus reset during loading of ASPI8XX.SYS. 

For example, if a SCSI bus reset is not desired during load, the line 
in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS would look like this: 

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /NORST


*   *   * Using the /ASK Option *   *    * 

This option prompts at system boot-up time about loading the 
ASPI8XX.SYS driver.

     Option Syntax: /ASK

For example, to activate this option, the line in your CONFIG.SYS 
file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this: 

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /ASK


*   *   * Using the /WIDTH (or /W) Option *   *    *

The width parameter defines the maximum data width negotiated with a device.
This option is used with host adapters capable of 16-bit data transfers. Valid
settings are 8 or 16.

     Option Syntax: /WIDTH=n<path[:id]>[,n<path[:id]>]*

For example, if your first host adapter (boot order designation = 0) is a 
16-bit adapter, and you wish to force 8-bit transfers to a device at 
SCSI ID 2, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS 
should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /WIDTH=8<0:2>


*   *   * Using the /DISCONNECT (or /DC) Option *   *   *

This option allows a device to disconnect since SCSI devices have the ability
to disconnect from the bus during an I/O transfer. If a particular host 
adapter has parity checking disabled, all devices attached to it must have  
disconnects disabled, since parity is required during the reselection phase. 

Valid options are ON (allow disconnects) or OFF (do not allow disconnects). The 
default for all devices is ON.

     Option Syntax: /DISCONNECT=n<path[:id]>[,n<path[:id]>]*

For example, to disable disconnects on the device attached to the first host 
adapter (boot order designation = 0) at SCSI ID 2, the line in the CONFIG.SYS 
file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /DISCONNECT=OFF<0:2>


*   *    * Using the /SYNCH_RATE (or /SR) Option *   *   *

This option sets the maximum synchronous transfer rate (in mega transfers per
second) to negotiate with a particular device. The allowable values are 0, 5, 10,
20, 40 and 80 providing the host adapter is capable of the specified speed. 
Specify 0 (zero) to turn off synchronous transfers for a particular device.  
The default value is the fastest rate supported by your host adapter.

     Option Syntax: /SYNCH_RATE=n<path[:id]>[,n<path[:id]>]*

For example, to turn off synchronous transfers to the device attached to the 
first host adapter (boot order designation = 0) at SCSI ID 3, the line in the 
CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this: 

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /SYNCH_RATE=0<0:3>


Note: When executing synchronous transfers using an 8-bit SCSI bus,
      mega bytes per second = mega transfers per second. Also, when you are
      doing synchronous transfers using a 16-bit SCSI bus, mega bytes
      per second = 2 * mega transfers per second.


*   *    * Using the /SYNCH_OFFSET (or /SO) Option *   *   *

This option sets the maximum synchronous offset in bytes used to negotiate 
with a particular device. The maximum allowable values are 0, 8, 16, 31 and 62
provided the host adapter is capable of the specified offset. Specify 0 (zero) 
to turn off synchronous transfers for a particular device.  
The default value is the fastest rate supported by your host adapter.

     Option Syntax: /SYNCH_OFFSET=n<path[:id]>[,n<path[:id]>]*

For example, to turn off synchronous transfers to the device attached to the 
first host adapter (boot order designation = 0) at SCSI ID 3, the line in the 
CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this: 

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /SYNCH_OFFSET=0<0:3>


*   *   *  Using the /PARITY (or /P) Option *   *   * 

This option tells the host adapter to disable the SCSI bus data integrity 
checking feature known as parity. Some SCSI devices do not generate parity.
Valid options are ON (check parity) or OFF (do not check parity). The default
for all devices is ON.

Warning: When disabling parity checking, also disable disconnects for that
         adapter since you cannot disable parity checking for reselection. 
         If a device does not generate parity, and it disconnects, the I/O 
         will never complete.

     Option Syntax: /PARITY=n<path[,path]*>[,n<path[,path]*>]*

For example, to turn off parity checking on the first host adapter (boot order
designation = 0), the line in your CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should
look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /PARITY=OFF<0>


*   *   * Using the /EXCLUDE (or /X) Option *   *   * 

This option allows you to exclude support for an adapter that does not currently
have BIOS support. You may not exclude an adapter that is supported (included) 
by the BIOS when you boot your system. This option has three required parameters:

    1. PCI Device ID
    2. PCI Bus Number
    3. PCI Device/Function Number

These parameters identify the specific adapter you want to exclude. To obtain
these parameters, boot your system using the /VERBOSE command line option
(explained later in this section). Your monitor displays the parameters for the
adapter or path you wish to exclude.

     Option Syntax: /EXCLUDE<a:b:c>[,<a;b;c>]*

For example, if you found the adapter you wish to exclude to have PCI Device
ID 3, PCI Bus Number 0, and PCI Device/Function Number 68, then the line in 
the CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /EXCLUDE<3:0:68>


*   *   *  Using the /HOST_ID (or /ID) Option *   *   *

This option lets you alter the SCSI ID for a host adapter. On an 8-bit adapter,
the SCSI IDs are 0-7. On a 16-bit adapter, the SCSI IDs are 0-15 (it is
suggested that IDs 8-15 not be used for your adapter). This option will not
allow you to select a SCSI ID already in use.

If the host adapter allows connection of both 8-bit and 16-bit devices to the
same bus, and the adapter number is changed to greater than 7, then the 8-bit
SCSI devices will not be able to reselect the initiator.

Note: You are not allowed to change the SCSI ID of any adapter currently 
      supported by the BIOS.

     Option Syntax: /HOST_ID=n<path>[,n<path>]*

For example, to change the SCSI ID of your second host adapter (path=1) to ID=6
(providing that adapter is not controlled by the BIOS), the line in the
CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /HOST_ID=6<1>


*   *   * Using the /TIMEOUT (or /T) Option *   *   *

The ASPI8XX.SYS driver uses a time-out mechanism to detect certain errors. When
the driver issues a command to a SCSI device, a timer is started. If the timer
expires before the command completes, the driver assumes something has gone
wrong, and takes steps to recover. The default for this option is 10 seconds,
if the device is BIOS controlled. If the device is not BIOS controlled, the 
default is 0. Also, non-volatile memory settings can alter these defaults. The
maximum setting is 0, which is no time-out. The range of allowable values is
0-65535 seconds.

     Option Syntax: /TIMEOUT=n<path[:id]>[,n<path[:id]>]*

For example, you might have a particularly slow device (with SCSI ID 3) on the
first host adapter (boot order designation = 0). If you wish to extend the
time-out for this device to 60 seconds, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that
loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /TIMEOUT=60<0:3>


*   *   * Using the /VERBOSE (or /V) Option *   *   *

This option causes more detailed information to appear on your monitor, after
the ASPI8XX.SYS driver is initialized, during a system boot. For example, the
following may be displayed after using the /VERBOSE or /V option:  

53C875 Rev 3 at PCI ID 15, Bus 0, Dev/Func 70h, CMD=0117h, SCRIPTS=FFFBE000h

This option is useful if you have multiple adapters in the system and need 
to know the PCI Device ID, the PCI Bus number, and the PCI Device/Function number
for each adapter. This information is required to use the /EXCLUDE option 
already described in this section.

     Option Syntax: /VERBOSE

For example, to see more detailed adapter information displayed when you boot,
the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads ASPI8XX.SYS should look like this:

DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS /VERBOSE


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The following are some potential problems and their suggested solutions.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

System Locks up at boot time. 

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

     a. Check for conflicts with other ASPI managers.

     b. Check for correct loading sequence in the CONFIG.SYS file.

     c. Boot the system.


*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The device driver does not recognize one of the non-boot SCSI peripherals
(system may lock up).

*   *   * Solution *   *    *

     a. Make sure the drivers were installed in the correct sequence. 

     b. Make sure the drivers' CONFIG.SYS line has the correct path to the drivers.

     c. Power down all units in the system.

     d. Make sure all SCSI devices have unique ID numbers.

     e. Make sure both ends of the SCSI bus are terminated.

     f. Check all cable and power connections.

     g. Boot the system.


************************ About Your SYMDISK.SYS Driver ************************


This section provides information concerning the pertinent features and 
description of the SDMS SYMDISK.SYS device driver. 

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Features *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

o  Supports up to 8 host adapters
o  Supports removable media devices
o  Supports magneto optical devices
o  Supports non-512-byte sectors (1024, 2048, 4096)
o  Supports multiple logical unit number (LUN) support
o  Supports OS/2 floppy format for MO and hard disks
o  Supports multiple host adapters when adapter has not been controlled by
   the SCSI BIOS (no INT13h devices)
o  Can reserve drive letters for installed devices without media present 
   in the device (see /UNITS under Command Line Options)
o  Can add drive letters
o  Supports power management (to spin down drives)


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Description *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   

The SYMDISK.SYS driver is needed when connecting drives with non-512-byte sectors,
and when connecting removable drives if the user wants to change the media. It is also
required to obtain drive letters for devices (adapters) that are not supported
by a BIOS. SYMDISK.SYS communicates through ASPI8XX.SYS. To use the SYMDISK.SYS 
driver you must load ASPI8XX.SYS also.


*********************** Installing Your SYMDISK.SYS Driver ********************

To install the SYMDISK.SYS driver, follow these steps:

1. Use the COPY command to copy the appropriate drivers from the SDMS SCSI 
   Drivers disk to your boot disk.

2. Add the lines shown below to the system's CONFIG.SYS file. The ASPI8XX.SYS
   driver is also required. List the drivers in this sequence:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS
     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Command Line Options  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SYMDISK.SYS device driver has several embedded functions that are accessed
via switches on the command line. These options are described below, and use the
following conventions:

[ ]  items in brackets are optional
 *   items in brackets followed by an * means repeat 0 or 
     more times
 |   choose one of the given items

IMPORTANT: No spaces are allowed in a single command line option, but spaces are     
           required between different command line options.


*   *   * Using the /ASK Option *   *   *

This option prompts the user at system boot-up whether to load SYMDISK.SYS or
not. To use this option, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMDISK.SYS should 
look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /ASK


*   *   * Using the /UNITS= Option *   *   *

Note: LSI Logic recommends that this option be used when using removable
      media with more than one partition.

The SYMDISK.SYS device driver allows the use of removable media, such as
cartridge hard drives, each of which might have a different number of partitions. 
If media with more than one partition are used, set this option to the maximum
number of partitions on any one media. To use this option, the line in the
CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMDISK.SYS should look like this (all on one line):

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /UNITS=path:id:lun:num_units
              [,path:id:lun:num_units]*

For example, if there is a removable media drive at SCSI ID 2 on the first host
adapter, and you need to reserve three partitions, the command line should look
like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /UNITS=0:2:0:3

When SYMDISK.SYS initializes, it defaults to either:

     a. One drive letter for a removable media device with no media present.

        -OR- 

     b. The number of partitions found on the media in the removable media 
        device.

Note: The full path, id, lun, and num_units values are required for this option. 
      Also, there is a limit of 24 devices.


*   *   * Using the /EXCLUDE= Option *   *   *

This option allows a user to exclude a "path:id:lun" combination from 
being scanned or controlled by SYMDISK.SYS. The path parameter is mandatory
with all ids and luns for that path excluded by default if just the path is
specified. To use this option, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads 
SYMDISK.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /EXCLUDE=path[:id[:lun]]
              [,path[:id[:lun]]]*

For example, if the path is 0, id 2, and lun 0, the command line should look 
like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /EXCLUDE=0:2:0

Note: There is a limit of 24 "path:id:lun" combinations allowed.


*   *   * Using the /SSIZE= Option *   *   *

The SYMDISK.SYS device driver defaults to the largest sector size found during
boot, handling all different sector sizes found. In the case of removable media, 
SYMDISK.SYS assumes a 2048 byte sector size when no media is present. This
option overcomes this limitation. To use this option, the line in the CONFIG.SYS
file that loads SYMDISK.SYS should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /SSIZE=512|1024|2048|4096

For example, if a removable media drive is used that has a sector size of 2048
bytes, the command line should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /SSIZE=2048

Note: If SYMDISK.SYS comes across a sector size larger than the one specified
      in this option, or if it finds a sector larger than the default, it will
      refuse to read/write to that media. It will report an invalid media error
      to DOS.


*   *   * Using the /SPINDOWN= Option *   *    *

This is a power management feature that automatically spins down a disk when
the disk is not accessed for a specified amount of time. The default spindown
time is 15 minutes. You can specify a new spindown time in hours and minutes
(hh:mm) with a minimum time of 1 minute. To use this option, the line in the
CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMDISK.SYS should look like this (all on one line):

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /SPINDOWN=hh:mm<path[:id[:lun]]>
              [,hh:mm<path[:id[:lun]]>]

For example, to spindown a device on path 0, id 2, and lun 0, after
one hour and five minutes of inactivity, the command line should look like this:

    DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /SPINDOWN=1:5<0:2:0>

-Or- 

To spindown all devices after the default time-out of 15 minutes,the command
line should look like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS /SPINDOWN=<>

Remember, the <> are required when you specify a path:id:lun in this option.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  

The following are some potential problems and their suggested solutions:

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The computer locks up and will not complete booting from a non-SCSI hard 
disk drive.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

     a. Refer to the drive manufacturer's user manual.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The computer locks up and will not complete booting from a SCSI hard disk drive.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

Note: If the SCSI BIOS is seen during boot, a banner similar to the following 
      appears:

      LSI Logic SDMS (TM) v4.0 PCI SCSI BIOS, PCI Rev. 2.0, 2.1
      Copyright 1995 LSI Logic PCI-4.09.00

a. Is the SCSI BIOS seen during boot?

   YES     Go to b.

b. Does the SCSI BIOS see the bootable SCSI drive?

Note: When the computer boots, SDMS scans the SCSI bus. Devices found on the
      SCSI bus are identified as in the following lines:

      HA ID  LUN   VENDOR       PRODUCT      REV 
     ---------------------------------------------------- 
      0  2    0    SEAGATE     ST31230N      0060
      0  7    0    LSI Logic   SYM53C815     0003

YES     Go to c.

NO      Power down all units in the system.
        Make sure the hard drives have different ID numbers (boot drive
        should have lowest ID).
        Make sure both ends of the SCSI bus are terminated.
        Check all cable and power connections.
        Check CMOS setup.
        Boot system.
        Go to a.

c. If boot is still unsuccessful, follow the solution to the next problem.

************************** About Your SYMCD.SYS Driver ************************

This section provides information concerning the pertinent features and 
general description of the SDMS SYMCD.SYS device manager.  

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Features  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   

o  Compatible with Microsoft's CD-ROM Extension 2.21 and above
o  Multi-session Photo CD support
o  Supports up to eight host adapters

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Description *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SYMCD.SYS device driver is needed whenever a CD-ROM device is connected on 
the SCSI bus. You must load it in conjunction with Microsoft's CD-ROM Extension
2.21 or above (MSCDEX.EXE). SYMCD.SYS communicates through ASPI8XX.SYS, so you
must load ASPI8XX.SYS to use SYMCD.SYS.


*********************** Installing Your SYMCD.SYS Driver *********************

To install the SYMCD.SYS driver, follow these steps:

1. Use the COPY command to copy the appropriate driver(s) from the SDMS SCSI
   Drivers diskette to your boot disk.

2. Add SYMCD.SYS to the CONFIG.SYS file. It goes in after ASPI8XX.SYS and
   SYMDISK.SYS (if this driver is also being used), in this order:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]ASPI8XX.SYS
     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMDISK.SYS
     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMCD.SYS /D:NAME

Note: The /D: is not a drive letter designation; it indicates the name you wish 
      assigned to your CD-ROM. You must include the NAME, which can use any 
      combination of up to 8 characters.

3. To ensure that sufficient drive letters are available to identify all 
   devices connected to the SCSI bus, add the MS-DOS LASTDRIVE command to the 
   CONFIG.SYS file:

      LASTDRIVE=x 

   where x specifies a drive letter in the range C through Z. The letter 
   assigned to LASTDRIVE represents the last valid drive MS-DOS is able to
   recognize and also represents the maximum number of drives available. For
   example, LASTDRIVE=K allows access to eleven (11) logical drives. For 
   further details about LASTDRIVE, consult your MS-DOS manual.

4. Unless your CD-ROM access software specifies otherwise, Microsoft's CD-ROM 
   Extension (MSCDEX.EXE) should execute from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in order to
   access your drive. Add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     [PATH]MSCDEX /D:NAME

   For example, if: 

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMCD.SYS /D:MY_CD 

   is in the CONFIG.SYS file, then:

     [PATH]MSCDEX /D:MY_CD

   should exist in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The /D: switches must match.

5. Check installation instructions for the CD-ROM drive itself for other
   parameters necessary to include with MSCDEX.

6. When MSCDEX is loaded during the AUTOEXEC.BAT file execution, a message is
   returned assigning a drive letter to the CD-ROM drive. For example:

      DRIVE E = DRIVER MY_CD UNIT 0

   This informs the user that the CD-ROM drive is recognized and ready for use.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Command Line Options *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SYMCD.SYS device driver has several embedded functions available that are
accessed via switches on the command line. An explanation of these options
follows:

IMPORTANT: No spaces are allowed in a single command line option, but spaces are 
           required between different command line options.


*   *   * Using the /ASK Option *   *   *

This option prompts the user at initialization time whether to load SYMCD.SYS or
not. For example, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMCD.SYS would look 
like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMCD.SYS /D:MY_CD /ASK


*   *   *  Using the /UPTOLUN= Option *   *   *

This option changes the default for multiple LUNs per Target ID on the SCSI bus.
The current default is to scan all LUNs. CD-ROM changers that use multiple LUNs
work by default. To turn off scanning all LUNs on a SCSI bus, choose /UPTOLUN=0.
This saves some time during boot.

For example, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMCD.SYS would look 
like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMCD.SYS /UPTOLUN=0

*   *   * Using the /NOBCD Option *   *   *

This option supports the Trantor Music Box CD audio application. Using this
option prevents the track numbers from being converted to BCD (Binary Coded
Decimal). If this option is used with CD audio applications such as Adaptec's
cdplayer, Corel's cd-audio, or Future Domain's cdaudio, track numbers >16 are
not reported correctly because these applications require binary track numbers.
For this option, the line in the CONFIG.SYS file that loads SYMCD.SYS would look
like this:

     DEVICE=C:[PATH]SYMCD.SYS /NOBCD


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The following are some potential problems and their suggested solutions:

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The CD-ROM drive is not seen at boot time, or the system locks up.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

     a. Make sure the required drivers are installed and in the correct sequence.

     b. Make sure the drivers' CONFIG.SYS line has the correct path to 
        the driver.

     c. Make sure MSCDEX, in the AUTOEXEC.BAT, has the same drive 
        name as the CD-ROM driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.

     d. Make sure there is no ID or drive letter designation conflict.

     e. Power down all units in the system.

     f. Check the cable and power connections.

     g. Make sure the SCSI bus is properly terminated.

     h. Make sure sufficient drive letters are specified (through the MS-DOS 
        lastdrive= command) to include your CD-ROM. A CD-ROM that uses multiple
        disks requires a letter for each disk.


***************** Important Additional Information For DOS Users **************

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Assignment of Drive Letters *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The MS-DOS operating system assigns drive letters to primary partitions 
first. After the primary partitions have been assigned drive letters the 
logical partitions are assigned drive letters. Do not assume that the drive 
letter designations will follow consecutively from device-to-device within a
PC system.

An Example:

A system is configured with an IDE hard disk as the boot drive, a SCSI hard
disk, and a CD-ROM drive. The IDE drive has three partitions: one primary and
two logical. The SCSI hard disk has two partitions: one primary and one
logical. The SCSI hard disk is assigned ID one, and the CD-ROM is ID four. The
distribution of the drive letters is:

     A: 3 1/2" floppy drive
     B: 5 1/4" floppy drive
     C: IDE primary partition
     D: SCSI primary partition
     E: IDE first logical partition
     F: IDE second logical partition
     G: SCSI logical partition
     H: CD-ROM
