This file describes the features and use of the LSI Logic SDMS device 
drivers for the Windows 2000 operating system environment. SDMS drivers
contain the same filename for different Windows operating systems. The
driver files are packaged either in separate subdirectories based on the
Windows operating system or on different flex disks. 

To determine the driver file for Windows 2000, note that the filename ends 
with ".sys". For example, SYMC8XX.SYS. (The same is true for Windows NT 4.0)
To determine the operating system version, go into Windows Explorer, 
display the driver file, right click on the filename, click on Properties,
and click on the Version tab. Finally, click on the Internal Filename in the
lower section. For Windows 2000, the filename appears as filename (NT 5.0).
For example, SYMC8XX.SYS (NT 5.0).

******************** Introduction for Windows 2000 ******************** 

Windows 2000 is an operating system designed to run on Intel-architecture
processors using current technology. It provides a graphical user interface
environment incorporating many high-level features (refer to the Microsoft
Windows 2000 documentation for details). An I/O manager handles I/O requests
in Windows 2000. To address a SCSI peripheral, the I/O manager goes through
the appropriate drivers. Class drivers for hard disk, floptical, CD-ROM,
printer, and scanner peripherals are provided in Windows 2000.
  
Other class drivers, provided by peripheral manufacturers, may be added
to support new devices. Tape device support is built into the operating 
system itself and does not require a class driver. Microsoft provides the
port driver and LSI Logic provides the miniport drivers. The LSI Logic
miniport drivers, SYMC8XX.SYS and SYM_HI.SYS, are bundled with Windows
2000. The LSI Logic miniport drivers, SYM_895A.SYS and SYM_U3.SYS,
are non-bundled drivers.  All LSI Logic miniport drivers are used to
complete the path to an LSI Logic SCSI controller or processor with an
optional SDMS SCSI BIOS. This document describes these drivers and their
installation. 


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Features *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

The miniport drivers support these features:

o  Ultra160 Data Transfers (for LSI53C1010)
o  Domain Validation (SYM_U3.SYS only)
o  Cyclic Redundancy Check (SYM_U3.SYS only)
o  Parallel Protocol Request (SYM_U3.SYS only)
o  Synchronous negotiation (including Fast SCSI/Ultra SCSI/Ultra2 SCSI) 
o  Wide negotiation 
o  Tagged command queuing 
o  Multiple host adapters 
o  Multiple Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) 
o  Disconnect/Reselect 
o  Scatter/Gather 
o  Differential support 
o  SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Disk array configurations with no LUN 0 
o  Disk array configurations with non-contiguous LUNs 
o  Target-initiated negotiation 
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: WIN2000 - 1 Mbyte  
o  NVRAM support (wide/sync parameters, SCSI Host ID) 


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  LSI Logic Devices Supported *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

All LSI Logic devices and host adapters have undergone a name change. 
They have transitioned from a SYM prefix to an LSI prefix. No name 
changes have occurred for the SDMS Windows 2000 drivers.   

The SYMC8XX.SYS driver is named "Symbios 53C8XX PCI SCSI Driver" for driver
installation. It supports the following devices and their associated LSI Logic
host adapters:

o  LSI53C810, LSI53C810A, LSI53C810AE (LSI8100S, LSI8100ASP, LSI20810)
o  LSI53C815 (LSI815XS, LSI8150SP)
o  LSI53C825, LSI53C825A (LSI8250S, LSI8251S, LSI8251D, LSI8250ASP,
   LSI8251ASP, LSI8251AD)
o  LSI53C860, LSI53C860AE (LSI8600SP, LSI20860)
o  LSI53C875, LSI53C875E (LSI8750SP, LSI8751SP, LSI8751SPE, LSI8751D)
o  LSI53C876 (LSI22801, LSI22802)
o  LSI53C885 
o  LSI53C895, (LSI8951U, LSI8952U)


The SYM_HI.SYS driver is named "Symbios PCI High Performance Driver" for
driver installation. It supports the following device and its associated
LSI Logic host adapters:  LSI53C896 (LSI22910, LSI21002, LSI22902)

The SYM_895A.SYS driver is named "Symbios 895A/8953U PCI SCSI Driver" for
driver installation. It supports the following device and its associated
LSI Logic host adapter:  LSI53C895A (LSI8953U)

The SYM_U3.SYS driver is named "Symbios Ultra3 PCI SCSI Driver" for
driver installation. It supports the following device and its associated
LSI Logic host adapter: LSI53C1010 (LSI8955U, LSI21040, LSI22903, LSI22915)

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Description *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, SYM_895A.SYS and SYM_U3.SYS drivers meet the
Microsoft specification for miniport drivers. These miniport drivers allow 
connection of SCSI devices including disk drives, CD-ROMs, and tape drives
for PCI-based machines. To support a new SCSI device, the Windows 2000 
architecture requires that a class driver for that type device be present
(usually supplied by Microsoft, or possibly by the peripheral manufacturer).
No changes to these drivers are required.

The SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, SYM_895A.SYS, and SYM_U3.SYS drivers described
in this document support Windows 2000 only. There are other versions of the
SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS,and SYM_U3.SYS drivers that are supported under
Windows NT 4.0. The SYM_895A.SYS driver is available for Windows 2000 only.
Note that the SYM_HI.SYS driver supports the LSI53C895A device and LSI8953U
host adapter for the Windows NT 4.0 operating system.

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the SCSI devices
by using the SCSI pass-through facility (refer to the Microsoft 
Windows 2000 documentation for details). This facility allows applications
to directly control and access SCSI devices by filling in a data structure
and calling into the port or class driver. The SYM_U3.SYS driver supports
Ultra160 SCSI protocol, providing twice the raw data transfer rate of Ultra2
protocol. Ultra160 includes double transition clocking, cyclic redundancy
check, parallel protocol request, and domain validation. The standard Ultra3
SCSI protocol performs 80 megatransfers per second resulting in approximately
double the synchronous data transfers rates of Ultra2 SCSI.

The SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, and SYM_895A.SYS drivers support Ultra SCSI
protocol, providing twice the raw data transfer rate of Fast SCSI for disk
drives and LSI Logic host adapters that support Ultra SCSI. These drivers also
support Ultra2 protocol, providing quadruple the raw data transfer rate of
Fast SCSI. The SYM_U3.SYS driver supports Ultra160 SCSI protocol providing
speeds up to 160 Mbytes/s data transfer for double transition clocking.

CAUTION: Ultra SCSI requires more stringent SCSI bus cabling setups than Fast 
         SCSI. Ultra2 and Ultra160 SCSI require low-voltage differential (LVD)
         termination.

Note: Please keep in mind that the Windows 2000 text-mode setup only displays
      the driver information, and not every controller found by that driver.


**** Installing the SYMC8XX.SYS/SYM_HI.SYS/SYM_895A.SYS/SYM_U3.SYS Driver ****

This section provides installation instructions for new and existing systems.

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * New System Installation *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

This procedure installs the SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, SYM_895A.SYS and/or SYM_U3.SYS
drivers onto a Windows 2000 system. Use this procedure when installing Windows
2000 onto an unused SCSI drive. Windows 2000 automatically adds the driver to
the registry and copies the driver to the appropriate directory.

The method for installing Windows 2000 on a new system involves using a CD-ROM.
Refer to the Microsoft document for installing Windows 2000 using boot floppy
diskettes.


CD-ROM Installation

The SYMC8XX.SYS and SYM_HI.SYS drivers are bundled with Windows 2000. These
drivers support the LSI53C8XX family of LSI Logic controllers, with the
exception of the LSI53C895A. The SYM_895A.SYS and SYM_U3.SYS drivers are non
-bundled drivers. The SYM_895A.SYS driver supports the LSI53C895A LSI Logic
controller. The SYM_U3.SYS driver supports the LSI53C1010.
   
1. Start the Windows 2000 installation by booting from the Windows 2000 CD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a CD-ROM. SDMS SCSI BIOS settings
   may need to be changed to allow CD-ROM booting.

2. Press the F6 key to install the SYM_895A.SYS or SYM_U3.SYS drivers when the
   screen displays "Windows 2000 Setup".

   This must be done or else these new drivers will not be recognized. If only
   the SYMC8XX.SYS and/or SYM_HI.SYS drivers are needed, no user action is
   required as they will be loaded from the CD-ROM automatically.

   Note: Be sure to press the F6 key as any driver loaded later in the
         installation process is not recognized by the Windows setup. 
         If F6 is not pressed, all devices controlled by the drivers are
         not available during Windows 2000 setup.

3. Choose S to specify an additional device when the screen displays "Setup
   could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices...". 

   NOTE: If this screen is not displayed as the first user input, then 
         pressing the F6 key was not seen by the setup program. Reboot the 
         system and try again.

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

4. Insert the appropriate SDMS driver diskette containing the Windows 2000
   driver required to support your LSI Logic adapter(s) and press Enter.
   Depending upon the media used to distribute SDMS drivers (web or CDROM),
   you will create an SDMS driver diskette. 
    
   NOTE: If both of these SDMS drivers need to be installed, they can be
         installed one after the other using steps 3 through 5. Installation
         order is not important.

   NOTE: Current Windows 2000 drivers can be downloaded from the LSI Logic 
         web site at http://www.lsilogic.com. After you are connected to this
         web site, place your cursor on the Get Drivers option in the menu bar. 
         Click on the Drivers selection. Choose the Windows 2000 operating 
         system for SCSI and click on the Go button. Follow the instructions 
         on subsequent screens to download the drivers.
  
5. Press Enter to proceed.

   Return to the Windows 2000 Setup screen.

6. Press Enter to proceed.

   The message about setup loading files appears.

7. Follow the Microsoft Windows 2000 installation procedure at this point.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Existing System Installation *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

This procedure installs or upgrades the SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, SYM_895A.SYS
and/or SYM_U3.SYS drivers onto an existing Windows 2000 system.

NOTE: When a LSI Logic adapter is added to an existing system installation, the
      new adapter is automatically detected at the next reboot.  For
      adapters controlled by the SYMC8XX.SYS or SYM_HI.SYS drivers, the
      bundled driver will be loaded automatically with no user intervention.
      For adapters controlled by the SYM_895A.SYS or SYM_U3.SYS drivers, the
      Device Driver Wizard will appear at boot. Click on the Next button and
      continue at step 7 below.

1. Boot Windows 2000 and log on as Administrator.

2. Right click on My Computer and click on the Properties selection. Click on
   the Hardware tab, and then the Device Manager button.

3. Click the "+" to the left of the SCSI and RAID controllers line.  Find the
   adapter desired for the driver upgrade and double-click the entry.  Click
   on the Driver tab.

4. Information on the currently installed driver is displayed, and additional
   driver details can be viewed by clicking the "Driver Details" button.

5. To update the existing driver, click the "Update Driver" button.  The
   Upgrade Device Driver Wizard begins.  Click on the Next button.

6. Make sure "Search for a suitable driver for my device" is selected, then
   click Next.

7. Make sure the "Floppy disk drives" location is checked, then insert the
   appropriate SDMS driver diskette containing the Windows 2000 driver
   required to support your LSI Logic adapter(s) and press Enter. Depending
   upon the media used to distribute SDMS drivers (web or CDROM), you
   will create an SDMS driver diskette.

   NOTE: Current Windows 2000 drivers can be downloaded from the LSI Logic 
         web site at http://www.lsilogic.com. After you are connected to this 
         web site, place your cursor on the Get Drivers option in the menu 
         bar. Click on the Drivers selection. Choose the Windows 2000 operating 
         system for SCSI and click on the Go button. Follow the instructions on 
         subsequent screens to download the drivers.

8. The system will scan the existing driver database and the floppy disk drive
   for drivers for the selected adapter. If a driver already exists on the
   system, and it is newer than the update driver on the driver diskette, a
   message is displayed giving the user the option to keep or reinstall the
   existing driver.

   In this case, if the user desires to use the upgrade driver anyway, click 
   the "Install one of the other drivers" box, then click Next. If no current
   driver exists, the driver on the driver diskette is displayed.

9. Click on the Next button.

    A list of suitable drivers appears. The entry for the upgrade driver
    can be verified by scrolling the display to the right, and viewing the
    Location field. 

10. Highlight the driver for the upgrade installation disk and click on the
    Next button.

    In some cases, a message will display saying that this driver is not
    digitally signed. This message informs the user that a non-signed driver
    is being installed and provides an opportunity for the user to cancel the
    installation (by clicking No).

    Note: Drivers are digitally signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality
          Lab (WHQL). Due to the time lag between the general customer release
          by LSI Logic of Windows drivers and the completion of WHQL testing,
          some drivers distributed with adapters or downloaded from the 
          www.lsilogic.com web site may not be digitally signed. 

11. Click No to cancel the installation if the nonsigned driver is not desired 
    or click Yes to continue the installation.

    The system loads the driver from the driver diskette. A message box
    may appear indicating that the target (existing) driver is newer than the
    source (upgrade) driver. 

12. Click No to cancel the driver upgrade at this point or click Yes to
    continue the installation.

    The system copies the driver to the system disk.

    For any adapter other than the boot adapter, the updated driver will become
    active immediately. For the boot adapter, a message box displays indicating 
    that the system must be rebooted for the new driver to take effect.

13. Click on the Finish button to complete the driver upgrade.

Note: When upgrading the driver on a multiple SCSI channel adapter, both
      channels of the adapter should be upgraded before the system is rebooted.
      Failure to do this can result in the upgraded driver being replaced by
      the original existing driver.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Performance Tuning for Windows 2000 *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Windows 2000 has registry entries that can be used to improve the performance 
of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The tunable parameters are large 
transfer block size support and a guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os for a 
particular SCSI bus.


*   *   * Large Block Size Support *   *   *

The SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, SYM_895A.SYS, and SYM_U3.SYS drivers can support
up to a 1 Mbyte transfer size in Windows 2000, however the default transfer size
is limited to 64 Kbytes. To enable a larger transfer size, an entry must be
added to the registry, using the file sym_256K.reg. This file will set a 256
Kbytes maximum, but it can be edited to set other desired maximum transfer
sizes. 

Important:  Be sure to read the information in the sym_256K.reg data file
            before editing it.

Choose one of two methods to add this registry setting:

1. Locate the sym_256K.reg data file (supplied with the driver files) using
   Windows Explorer and double click on the file.
 
   -or-

2. Type at the command prompt:

     regedit sym_256K.reg

This inserts an entry in the registry to enable 256K block size support. 

Editing the SYM_256K.reg file can set any maximum block size between 64 Kbytes
and 1 Mbyte (-8 Kbytes). The formula to calculate the proper value for
MaximumSGList is:

     MaximumSGList = (Maximum Block Size)/4K +1

For 256 Kbytes: 256K/4K = 64 Kbytes, add 1 for 65 (decimal) or 0x41(hexadecimal).
The maximum value allowed for MaximumSGLIst is 255 or 0xFF. This denotes an 
absolute maximum transfer size of 1040384, which is 8 Kbytes less than 1 Mbyte
(1040384/4K = 0xFE, add 1 for 0xFF or 255).

The system must be rebooted for the new registry setting to be effective.

To reset the maximum block size to the default of 64 Kbytes, follow the
instructions above, except use symdfblk.reg as the data file.


*   *   *  Maximum Number of Concurrent I/Os (Guaranteed) *   *   *  

Windows 2000 only guarantees a maximum of 32 concurrent I/Os active on a
particular SCSI bus. However, due to the method of memory allocation, the
actual limit of concurrent I/Os can vary greatly between various drivers or
versions of drivers. This can have a huge impact on performance benchmarking
between different driver versions or adapter vendors. In effect, one adapter
may actually be able to have 70 or 80 I/Os outstanding, while another adapter
could only have 32. This can also affect systems with high performance storage
subsystems, such as disk arrays.

In order to have a guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os, an entry must be 
added to the registry, using the file sym100io.reg.

Important:  Be sure to read the information in the sym100io.reg data file
            before editing it. 

Choose one of two methods to add this registry setting:

1. Locate the sym100io.reg data file (supplied with the driver files) using
   Windows Explorer and double click on the file.

   -or-

2. Type at the command prompt:

     regedit sym100io.reg

This inserts an entry in the registry to guarantee a maximum of 100 
concurrent I/Os per adapter.

If a maximum other than 100 is desired, the sym100io.reg file can be edited.
The system administrator should be aware that increasing the number of
concurrent I/Os from the default of 32 will use increasing amounts of
non-paged pool memory. High values for this setting can degrade system
performance.

The system must be rebooted for the new registry setting to be effective.

To reset the guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os to the default of 32, 
follow the instructions above, except use symdefio.reg as the data file. 


*   *   * Auto Request Sense *   *   *

Enabling and Disabling Auto Request Sense is found in the section titled 
"Troubleshooting."

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Disk Mirroring *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Note: This section applies only to Intel x86-platforms where the SDMS 4.XX 
      PCI SCSI BIOS is used.

The SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS loads only one image into the system memory at boot 
time regardless of how many host adapters are used in the system. All of the 
disk drives on all host adapters will be recognized through the INT13h function 
call. Because of this implementation, disk mirroring under Windows 2000 needs
to be done by following instructions which might be different from the
Microsoft documentation.

To create an Windows 2000 Fault Tolerant (FT) floppy diskette so that you can
boot from the mirrored partition in case the primary partition fails, follow
these steps:

1. Format a floppy diskette in drive A: using Windows 2000 (Windows Explorer 
   or My Computer) for use as a Fault Tolerant boot floppy.

2. From the root directory of the primary partition, copy NTLDR, 
   NTDETECT.COM, and BOOT.INI to this floppy diskette.

3. Temporarily remove the read-only attribute of the BOOT.INI file so that it 
   can be modified and saved.

4. Edit the BOOT.INI file on the FT floppy diskette and modify the following 
   line where you want to boot the mirrored partition:

        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(x)partition(y)\<winnt_directory>

    where:
    
     multi(0) and disk(0) should always remain same.

     x = the drive number of the mirrored partition in the INT13 chain minus 80h.

     The drive number of the mirrored partition can be found during system 
     bootup of the SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS when the primary partition does
     not exist. It should say either BOOT (=80h), 81h, 82h, and higher. 
     Therefore, the value of x would be 0 when BOOT, 1 when 81h, 2 when 
     82h, etc.

     y = the partition number on the drive (starts at 1 which equals single 
     partition on the drive)

     The next example provides a scenario to better illustrate the above
     information.
   
     EXAMPLE: Two LSI Logic 8xx host adapters are in the system. 

     The first HBA, HBA #0 which is the boot path, has two SCSI hard drives on 
     ID 0 and ID 5. The second host adapter,HBA #1, has two SCSI hard drives on 
     ID 2 and ID 4. Assuming that the SCSI bus scan starts from ID 0 and goes up,
     the drive number of INT13h will look like this:

       HBA #0, ID 0= BOOT (which is 80h)    
       HBA #0, ID 5= 81h    
       HBA #1, ID 2= 82h    
       HBA #1, ID 4= 83h    

     Now Windows 2000 is installed on the boot drive, HBA #0 ID 0, and a mirrored 
     partition is established on HBA #1 ID 2. If the primary partition fails, 
     for example due to power failure, then the drive number of INT13h will 
     change:

       HBA #0, ID 5= BOOT (which is 80h)   
       HBA #1, ID 2= 81h    
       HBA #1, ID 4= 82h    

     Therefore, the following line should be used in the BOOT.INI file on the 
     Windows 2000 Fault Tolerant boot floppy to boot from the mirrored partition,
     HBA #1 ID 2. Note that rdisk(1) was calculated from x=81h minus 80h.

        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)partition(1)\<winnt_directory> 

5. Save the BOOT.INI and restore the "read-only" attribute.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

Some potential problems and their suggested solutions are:

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

During installation, no SCSI devices are found.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Ensure that the custom setup is chosen on the Setup Method screen.

b. Ensure that all devices are powered on and terminated correctly.

c. Check that no devices have duplicate SCSI IDs.

d. Make sure INT A is assigned for the PCI slot(s) where your SCSI host 
   adapter(s) are installed.

e. Ensure that all devices can be seen in the display banner of the SDMS
   SCSI BIOS at boot time.


*   *   * Problem *   *   *

System crashes during installation with a message indicating inaccessible 
boot device.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. This error is usually associated with an IRQ, DMA channel, I/O (chip) 
   address, or BIOS address conflict. Set the SCSI host adapter to use a 
   different interrupt.

b. A virus sometimes causes this error that infects the Master Boot Record 
   of the boot device. Use a write-protected DOS bootable flex containing 
   virus scanning and cleaning software to check for any viruses on the boot 
   device, and remove if any are found.


*   *   * Problem *   *   *

A disk drive is recognized as seven different devices when only one is 
physically connected to the SCSI bus.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

Older SCSI devices that incorrectly indicate to Windows 2000 that they
support multiple LUNs usually cause this error. Contact the device
manufacturer for a firmware upgrade.


*   *   * Problem *   *   *

Problems with SCSI devices installation or operation

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

If a SCSI device is not operating properly (either the device is not found 
or a SCSI interface error occurs during scanning), it is possible that the 
third-party device drivers do not support the auto request sense feature 
of LSI Logic host adapters. Disable the auto request sense feature as 
described below and try the device operation again.

a. To disable the auto request sense feature, use the symno_ar.reg file 
   (supplied with the SDMS driver installation files), and double click
   on the file in Windows Explorer;

   -or-

   Type at the command prompt:

   regedit symno_ar.reg  

   This inserts a registry entry that disables the auto request sense feature.
   The system must be rebooted for this change to take effect.

b. To re-enable the auto request sense feature, use the file "sym_auto.reg"
   and perform one of the update methods described in the preceding paragraph.

Problems with certain SCSI devices when using an Ultra SCSI adapter.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Some SCSI devices do not function properly when the adapter attempts to 
   negotiate Ultra SCSI transfer rates. If a device is not operating 
   properly, check the transfer speed setting using the SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS 
   Configuration Utility (press Ctrl-C when the LSI Logic SDMS PCI BIOS banner
   appears during the system boot process). Devices that do not support Ultra
   SCSI should be set to a maximum of 10 Mbytes/s for 8-bits, and 20 Mbytes/s
   for 16-bits.

Problems with Ultra160 SCSI devices using Ultra160 SCSI protocol.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. If the system is configured with a LSI Logic host adapter that supports 
   Ultra160 SCSI and an Ultra160 SCSI device is on the SCSI bus, intermittent
   problems and possible system crashes can occur if the SCSI bus cable and
   terminators do not conform to the Ultra160 SCSI specification.

b. Disable Ultra160 SCSI support for all devices using the SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI
   BIOS Configuration Utility (press Ctrl-C when the LSI Logic SDMS PCI BIOS
   banner appears during the system boot process).

c. If the system operates properly without Ultra3 SCSI enabled, it is highly 
   likely that the SCSI bus cable and terminators are not configured 
   correctly for Ultr160 SCSI. See the LSI Logic host adapter user's guide 
   for information on Ultra160 SCSI cabling requirements.


*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The system hangs at boot, has a long boot time, or SCSI device not available.

Some older SCSI devices do not tolerate Domain Validation operations.  At
system boot time, Domain Validation is performed to test the data integrity of
the SCSI bus between the host adapter and each target device.  With some older
SCSI devices, these operations can cause the device to stop responding to SCSI
commands.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

Disable Domain Validation, either for a specific SCSI target or all adapters
controlled by a specific driver.

a. To disable Domain Validation for a specific SCSI target, use the SDMS 4.XX 
   PCI SCSI BIOS Configuration Utility to set the Sync Rate to 0 (async) and
   the Data Width to 8. This target will be running in async/narrow mode and
   no Domain Validation operations will be performed on it.
  
b. To disable Domain Validation for all host adapters controlled by this 
   driver, use the file symno_dv.reg (supplied with the SDMS driver files).
   Either double click on the file in Windows Explorer or My Computer or type
   "regedit symno_dv.reg" at the command prompt. This inserts a registry entry
   that disables Domain Validation operations. The system must be rebooted for
   this change to take effect.

c. To re-enable the Domain Validation feature, use the file "sym_domv.reg" and
   perform one of the update methods described in the preceding paragraph.
